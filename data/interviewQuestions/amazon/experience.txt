Called out of the blue, asked if I'd be interested in interviewing. Still not entirely sure how they got my name. Had first phone interview the next week, asked no personal questions, all technical in nature. Total of 3 phone interviews and an in-person trip out to Seattle. Took about 4 months start to finish. The people in the in person interview were wonderful. Very smart, laid back, and understanding. Got lunch, small tour of campus, and learned what I'd be doing. Got the offer 2 business days after the in person interview. Sadly, I signed a NDA and I respect the terms of that. As such, I can't give you any specific questions, but I'll gladly give you the best advice I have. Phone Interviews : Phone interviews are sucky by nature. Coordinating a call from west to east coast alone is painful, add the fact that phones just take away the benefits of body language, and just make it harder to hear, and you've got a recipe for disaster. But fear not! Here are some helpful hints, some of which are obvious, some of which are not. 1. Get ready ahead of time. I just mean, get to the area you'll be doing the interview beforehand. I'd recommend an hour or more, just to get your nerves ready. Breathe, get used to the surroundings, and get everything laid out ahead of time. Which brings me to... 2. I know it's a "programming" interview, but for the love of all things good, have a pen and paper ready and at your disposal. Bring a backup pen. Much like a printer, the pen will fail at the worst possible time. You may also need a laptop, as I was asked to do "on the fly" programming. But close anything and everything distracting. Speaking of... 3. Pick a spot where there are no distractions. You'll want your undivided attention on this interview. Don't have BookTweet or FaceSpace or MyGram or that crap open if you have a laptop. And I personally wouldn't pick a public space, you never know when an annoying parent will put their screaming child right beside you. 4. Breathe. Just breathe. Take a moment, stretch, and remember you got this. If you have trouble hearing, don't be afraid to ask again. Don't be afraid to say you don't know. Do as for clarifications, and state assumptions up front. Always re-state the problem as you understand it. As for the content : For the love of God, know what a time complexity is, and how to determine it for any and all code you write. Know the time complexities of all sorts. Know all data structures, how to use them, and properties of each. (Insertion time, deletion, etc) Generally know what heck you're talking about. But don't talk too much. You don't want silence at any point really, but you certainly don't want to let the interviewer not get a word in. Know graph theory, tree theory, and all the fun stuff associated with more "complex" structures. Understand what your language does behind the scenes, as far as GC and compiling go. Know how your language use internal structures to manage the code/objects you write. **Continued below**

White board coding interview with engineers/tech leads. I was called on campus a day before and was provided with hotel stay. The hotel is pretty close to the office to one can walk to the campus easily. I was provided with lunch first and the interview process began. I wasn't prepared much but in my opinion, the interview was fairly simple. Make sure your object oriented concepts are clear to be able to solve the design questions. Data structures is equally important along with its Algorithmic complexity.

It was a good detailed oriented process that touched up on various technical aspects of coding and developing software. It was a pleasant experience over all. It had two different telephonic rounds, coupled with 4 technical rounds. Had an informal lunch sponsored by Amazon with the recruiting manager who detailed the various goals non-goals of team along with aligning of interests' discussion

Lots of behavioral questions probing different Amazon leadership principles. The white board coding questions were similar to those from Cracking the Coding Interview or a similar book. Definitely study for this interview and practice programming without a computer.   1 Answer

There was an initial phone screen that was almost entirely technical questions. There were two programming questions that I typed into a shared editor and a few more general questions about data structures and algorithms. The interviewer was a little disinterested. After the phone screen I was invited for a full day of 6 interviews. Since I had applied to two teams there were two manager interviews and 4 technical interviews. They really hammered me with behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when..."). I could see this getting exhausting if I wasn't expecting it. I definitely recommend jotting down more than one example for each of the Amazon leadership principles. They didn't ask about them directly but most questions were probing in the direction of one or more. Even the technical interviewers ask these kinds of questions. They are definitely looking to see if I would fit in with the Amazon culture as much as whether I was technically qualified. Everyone was extremely nice and obviously competent making the experience much less stressful than it could have been. I got the offer the next day via a recruiter e-mail and phone call. Over the next couple weeks the hiring managers and recruiters kept in constant contact. I met with the managers again in a less formal setting. They were very approachable and honest and willing to answer any questions I had. I felt a little pressure, but they were professional and reasonably patient as long as I kept them in the loop.

Was contacted by university recruiter requesting an onsite interview. Did not complete any phone screens prior. I think this was either from me handing in my resume at my university's career fair, or just plain luck. Flew me out one week later to Seattle, WA for a day of onsite interviews. Interview structure was different than normal -- work in a group with other interviewees to complete a project. It was a group collaboration project, but coding was done individually. Throughout the entire day, we were to code our individual parts while getting selected for 1 on 1 interviews (twice) during the day. The 1 on 1 interviews were very slack, they just asked what we were coding for that project, nothing in-depth technical. Got a good hotel, good reimbursements, had a good time in Seattle. Got the offer 8 days later. Probably will take it.

Process: Referred by friend, contacted by recruiter, followed by a technical phone screen. Since glassdoor doesn't seem to have a section to tell my views about this interview, I am putting them here. The technical interviews taken by Amazon is increasingly being shaded by unprofessional people. I was asked about 5-6 verbal questions to gauge my technical ability- Each answered to perfection by me, followed by a coding question, which too was answered correctly however we mutually worked out a bunch of test cases. Please refer the answers to the questions asked to me in this review below. Despite of this, the interviewer blatantly rejected me on the same day shortly after the interview(as I got email shortly after). I am not sure what they are looking for but I plan to ban interviewing them for rest of my life as a Software engineer. **And I seriously hope that interviewer gets to read this, as these recruiters never tell them our views about their interviewing**

One phone call to schedule the interview was followed by another and another. Not only was the time and date changing each time, but also who I would be interviewing with. By the time I was able to find someone to conduct the interview, it ended up being so rushed and short that I was wondering what the point of even doing it at all. At the end I was told by the interviewer that she would contact me again shortly, but that never happened. Obviously there was a lot of internal confusion or miscommunication throughout the whole process. Not sure how common this is.

Onsite at Houston, there were 4 technical interviews in front of a whiteboard. Good mix of questions. Got a call back saying that the bar raiser thought I'd be good for a management role so I did a phone interview for that but I had a very hard time understanding the interviewer because of his Indian accent. I found a decent solution to the programming question in that interview but was told I was not going to be offered the management position but would be offered an SDE position, the recruiter talked about compensation but would not mention a base salary, only total compensation package, which is fine, but I make my decisions on my known budget and if I can afford rent in the location. Then I heard nothing for several days and was finally passed to another Amazon recruiter. She said that I had a phone call with a team manager to see if it was a good fit, she specifically said it would not be technical that I had allready passed all that. The phone call started out with very bad feedback, the interviewer was using some software that made an echo of everything I said. It was very disorientating to be talking about my past projects but hear my voice repeat. He turned whatever it was off then then drilled into one project in particular in an area that I had said I didn't setup. Then asked an algorithm question, which I found a medium level solution for. It was very adversarial feeling. Very strange company that they state that hiring is there number one focus. I think not hiring is really there number one goal, because after that call the recruiter said she was confused by what happened as well and said she'd try me with 2 more teams for a fit. It's been 4 days since she said that so I've pretty much written them off. No one that I've talked to seems to be a decision maker, if a company makes a verbal offer and says over and over that they want to hire you, why not just finalize it and figure out placement later. Company seems great if you know what your getting into, but the hiring process seems convoluted.

The interviews at Amazon were a complete waste of my time, the process wasn't enjoyable at all. Had contact with multiple Amazon recruiters over phone and email and it was very poorly run. Some recruiters didn't get back to me, some did. The overall process was chaotic and you're treated like a number. After passing the phone interview I was invited on-site. My takeaway is that Amazon treats its potential employees like they are expendable and they're only interested if you can pass the technical part which is okay, but they also want to know if they can overwork you. I wouldn't apply to Amazon unless you knew full well of Amazon's work environment, and the interviews only validated Amazon's terrible work environment and culture that I've read about. The positive aspect is you'll be working with very smart individuals, but these same individuals may be difficult to work with especially with the cut-throat environment Amazon fosters.

The recruiter contacted me by email for this position to set up a phone technical interview. The technical interviewer was nice and polite but I think he was more nervous than I was. He was unwilling to engage in even a few sentences of small talk. The phone interview consisted of a few programming questions such as Write an atoi function. Write a function to find pairs of number that add up to a given value. Two of the questions were JAVA specific language concept questions, even though the job requirement was for C or JAVA. One of which was, what is type erasure? One question was on my approach to general problem solving. And one programming style question. My impression was that the interviewer had the answers to the question in front of him but did not have any in-depth understanding of the concepts. I felt that this might have been a training session for the interviewer. Granted this also might be sour grapes because I did not get an offer.

Online coding challenge followed by a 4-hr on-site interview. Interview questions ranged from easy to very difficult. The easy part I could have done much better but I started coding right away (because I was asked to) BEFORE I had a plan of how I could solve the problem. As a result, what I wrote on the whiteboard was so messy even I myself got confused. Practicing writing code on paper was not enough, you needed to practice with an audience, and made sure he/she understands what you're trying to do from start to finish. Word of advice, start designing with your interviewer (regardless of how much they push you to start coding), before coding.

Simply apply online and got a online test which is very simple (the most difficult question is insertion sort) After the online test, there's a 1-hour phone interview. And it's the final procedure. For the phone interview, the interviewer first introduce himself and ask you to describe one project you've done. Then you're asked to solve two problems, with one for algorithm for sure. Then you can ask him a question. The interviewer is very nice. But it's my fault to mess up the interview (too nervous for the first interview :( so I bet I'm rejected.

Five individual interviews, each more interested in assessing whether or not I'll "fit in" with the group than whether I have the chops. Online technical interview before in-person interviews basically already flagged you for having the skills they think they want. In my case, I was recruited and then assigned to a job where they thought I would be most useful, but they didn't really want me -- they wanted a duplicate of one of the other cogs.

They don&amp;#039;t have specific questions. They do, however, have &amp;#034;leadership principles&amp;#034; for which they are assessing you, usually one per interviewer.

The total process of Amazon is really slow....I went through employee referral, OA and final onsite these three phases. Now I will talk about onsite experience: There are four round interviews for onsite interview. Every round begins with some general resume questions such as "tell me about your most proud project/activity" etc. Then the interview is followed by one or two algorithm question: Round one: 1. compare two trees return if they are equal; 2. merge sort(follow up: how about have two large files with each contains a bunch of number) Round two: 1. max subarray sum(follow up: can you do that without array); 2.zigzag travel of a tree Round three:1. given an integer, start from the end put a comma after first three digits, and for the rest, put a comma after every two digits, return final string; 2. I can't remember very clearly about this round, but I do remember it's a dfs or bfs search for a maze with additional constraints such as "each time I can only go forward and turn right" Round four: implement the checkin and checkout interface, I think this problem has been mentioned in previous reviews Generally, Amazon onsite is not hard but I still don't get offer, maybe I performed badly for behavior questions. As for algorithm, it's just about searching, sorting and a little dynamic programming. As for data structure, I heard that they prefer array and string than tree.

We discussed the problems in OA and I got the chance to ask him some questions about Amazon.

I took the Algorithms class on coursera (they offer two sequential classes). That was probably one of the most helpful things. Those classes go over exactly what you need to know - data structures, algorithms, etc. They didn't ask me directly about the data structures (i.e. What is a hash table?) but I did need to know exactly what my options were and the properties of each data structure. For each problem, I had to choose which structures were appropriate and explain why. So I had to know them inside and out. I would strongly recommend going through all the common data structures and refreshing how they work, what they are best for, and the complexity of each operation. I would also suggest learning about Amazon specifically - what their teams do, what languages and database systems they use. I did, so I was able to ask my interviewers good questions. During the interview, I was extremely nervous but I made sure to talk through everything I was doing and thinking about even if I didn't have a solution in mind right away. I recommend trying to minimize silent moments.

It started with HR phone screen, then a technical phone screen, and finally on-site interview. The process goes very smoothly and basically you could know the result in a short time. Very efficient and nothing to complain about. However, the on-site interview is also very fast-paced, which means if you don't complete the questions in time, you wouldn't get a chance to ask the interviewer any questions. Some interviewers are pretty good but some are just okay and might make you feel that he doesn't care what you're talking about ;).

I applied online. After that I got an email from the recruiter about an Online Assessment Test. I took the test, it was 20 min and about debugging skills and how to read others code and fix bugs. After that I received an email to move to the second round. I got a phone interview from one of their engineers. The telephone interview was mostly about data structures and algorithms and about my background. After less than a week I received the offer. I signed it and sent it back to them. However, after more than one month they retracted it claiming that Amazon does not apply for export control licenses for candidates from embargoed countries. I was just shocked that it took them this much time to realize that. It is disappointed for them to do that after we went this far with the process. I asked for an exception or placement in a team that does not require export licenses, but there was just no hope. I missed two interesting opportunities because of that.

They set you up for 3 interviews and if they "need more data" they ask you to do a 4th interview. The first interview was crazy difficult (it was clearly the bar raiser) I was able to answer the question but made a few coding mistakes. I would give myself a C, the next two were not really difficult if you prepared, I would give myself a B+. I was then told I would need to interview a fourth time. The fourth interview was all technical and comprised of 2 technical questions. I like to believe that my answers were close to perfection and finished under time. I was shocked when I learned that they would not make me an offer.

Contacted by a Recruiter. I was asked to take the online assessment test. Coding questions in online interview were very simple and straightforward. Called for an onsite interview at seattle. There were 4 rounds. 1. Couldn't categorize as what category the questions belongs to. It was more like a big word problem. When asked about some details on the question, the interviewer made it even more puzzling adding extra criteria. The interviewer dropped the question half way and started asking one word questions after that. May be he declared my result at that instance itself. 2. Matrix Dynamic programming. Not the one I heard before. But was able to give the solution well ahead of time. 3. Question on Linked List, Basic Array. Again completed well ahead of time. So, the interviewer started asking some common questions. 4. Question on BST. Was able to answer the question. Completed the round with a set of behavioral questions. The interviewer looked totally uninterested with my approaches or what I was saying.

This is the story of how I Bombed That Interview but had a pleasant time doing it. I was initially contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. They were interviewing for one or more positions in Seattle, USA, but for some reason they were traveling all the way to my part of the world (hint: Not USA) and making a big hiring event. Apparently, "new talent" is hard to come by in Seattle these days. After sending the recruiter my CV, I was directed to a website to do a coding exercise that took about two hours to finish. A few days later, I was invited to an "on-site" interview at the recruiting event. At this point, the event was about three weeks away. The interview event consisted of two interviews with a possible third or fourth interview "if we need to know more". Each interview was 50 minutes with a 10 minute break in between. The first interviewer was a Software Engineer and after a short chat about my work experience, I was given a code exercise and asked to write my solution on the whiteboard. Several days of preparation doing Codewars problems and trying my luck with paper and pencil coding did not prepare me for my biggest enemy: Complete Nuclear Meltdown (in the brain). I simply could not think straight in the situation so although I eventually arrived at something that worked, it was not pretty and it took too much time. The second interview was identical to the first but the interviewer was a Manager with a background in coding. Once again, the coding exercise made me pretty flustered. As an example, I realized a few days later that I had created an endless loop even after going over the code two times on the whiteboard. Whoops. After the first two interviews, I was told that my interview was over which was a pretty clear message that things had not gone right because they had mentioned the possibility of three and four interviews. A week later, I was called by the recruiter who confirmed what I already knew: No offer for me. To be fair, there could have been other things contributing to their decision than my coding abilities but unfortunately, they have a policy of not providing feedback to candidates, so I will never know if they also thought I was lacking in other areas. Overall, the communication was very smooth and professional and all the people I interacted with were very nice so the experience was pleasant. Biggest takeaway from all this: Practice more and try and keep a cool head.

During the conversations I got some information about the team they were hiring for, expectations from a candidate, and I provided some information about myself. Then recruiter asked how much time I needed to be prepared for the technical phone screen and scheduled it the next week after my response. The phone screen was conducted by an experienced engineer and it was 1-hour long. They called the next day after the phone screen and informed me that I passed the interview and invited me to on-site interview in Seattle. The company paid for my flight to/from Seattle as well as for my 2-night stay in 4-star hotel close to the office. They even reimbursed taxi to/from airport, meals and car parking in my local airport. Recruiter was nice and very helpful in the process, she prepared me for behavioral questions that would be asked. I had 5 interviews 45 minutes each during the day. Everyone was nice and friendly, questions were not very hard but still required deep and careful thinking.

A complete waste of time going onsite! Got a mail from the recruiter for a "Group-coding" challenge for the SDE position. The challenge starts at 10 in the morning after a brief about the company. The problem was about scheduling ads using Amabot where the problem divides into 3 1. Scheduling, 2. Validation, 3. Optimization. It took about an hour to decide the who takes what and understanding the problem was really hard although the API was given. Then came a discussion with the developers about the problem and that lasted for half an hour; noon over. Two hours later another discussion about the problem where I found out that I had made a mistake in the logic. Bid adieu for my hopes in the evening. An advice to the fellow interviewees: Please avoid this format of interviews as this does not completely reflect the kind of problem solving capability and opt for one on one where an interaction will make the problems to be understood.

It was pretty straightforward, in my case. An online assessment that involved critical reading, math as well as logic problems (plain standardized testing), a coding portion that was pretty straightforward, and then I got the opportunity to fly up to Seattle. At the on-site interview, we had 4 straight rounds, each about 45 minutes long, of one-on-one interviewing. They covered what I thought were standard topics, such as Big O, sorting, data structures, etc. There were design as well as code-oriented problems, all of them definitely study-able. Then a few weeks later, they emailed me with the offer.

An online code test followed by logic and personality tests. Interviewed on-site in Seattle and spoke with four interviewers. There were probably 20 other candidates interviewing that day.

I got an employee referral. The recruiter reached to me in 3 weeks and asked me to do an online assessment. And I got rejected two days later. I think a interactive phone interview would be much better than the online assessment. For the 24 logical questions, it would be much easier if you have a number-alphabet table by your hand.

1. finding if two binary number are consecutive grey code. (i.e. only one bit difference) 2. finding if two string are rotation to each other. (i.e. return true if s1 = "abcde" s2 = "cdeab") And 24 easy logical questions.   Answer Question

It was a new graduate interview so candidates were divided and literately interviewed one to one by four interviewers. Apparently one of them was "bar raiser". The whole progress took near the whole day and most of them are algorithm questions. You need to write them on white board. Basically the interview was in an average difficulty. You need to practice the algorithm before interview and know how to analysis time / space complexity.

As far as I remember, I had following questions. Write a function to implement Huffman encoding. Several principle of OOP in Java such as abstract vs interface, what is static function, how built-in java sorting implemented, etc. Reverse a singly lined list. Nearest ancestor node of binary tree. Write a function to shift array and the follow up was to analysis the possibility of each element got shifted. The last one was like, give you a function which is written in O(n^2), you need to figure out what is it doing for and try to use dynamic programming to optimize it. It is one in LeetCode.   Answer Question

Contacted by email out of the blue and asked for an on-site interview for the position. Flew to Seattle HQ and interviewed there. The process was very quick and well organized. Due to NDA I cannot discuss the format or details of the interview but the interview was very different from any other tech companies. The format and question asked were more related to actual programming than the usual questions you'd see from the book.

I missed a hiring event earlier in the week, but a friend referred me to a recruiter that contacted him earlier last month. I emailed her and had a brief conversation to ask what I'm currently doing at my job and why I'm looking to leave. Afterwards, she set me up with a 90-minute remote interview using collabedit.com. She recommended using www.topcoder.com and www.careercup.com to prepare for the interview. Almost a week later, I had the phone/ coding interview: 1. Find the intersection of two arrays a. What's the time and space complexity? b. Can you improve performance? i.e. What if arrays were sorted? c. Which sort would you choose? d. What if provided and unknown number of arrays? 2. Given a binary search tree, write a method to add a new node to the tree (without re-structuring) P.S. I heard from a fellow Amazon friend that they are changing up the interview process, so I'm not sure if this is what it's moving to since he said that he had 2 45-minute interviews before proceeding to the on-site interview.

Referred by a friend of mine who is an employee. A few days following the referral I was contacted by a recruiter who asked for a current version of my resume and gave me an overview of what the team I was interviewing for did. A few days later I had a phone interview in which we discussed my background as well as solving a coding problem live on colabedit.com. About half a week after the phone I was asked to fly up to Seattle for an on-site interview. This consisted of 4 back to back interviews (including one lunch interview). The lunch interview is all behavioral. Of the other three, 2 were about 33% behavorial, 66% whiteboard coding. The last interview felt more like a knowledge test, being asked a series of basic algorithm and data structure questions pretty rapid fire. Having told them I had other offers outstanding, the recruited informed me that they would have a decision within the next two days. Received their decision by call the day following the interview

I got an email out of the blue asking me if I wanted to fly to Seattle and interview. I still don't know where they got my resume; but I assume it was from when I applied for a co-op position a year before. I was excited to go, but from the very start I got the impression it was going to be tough. I got an email about a week beforehand with about 8 attachments containing literature about the company. I was informed that I would be doing a programming problem for most of the day, and I would have my choice of language, compiler, and OS. When I arrived on campus, we were given visitor badges and told to wait until someone came to get us. I felt weird that the majority (at least 75%) of interviewees were foreign students. It made me feel like I was out of my league. We were taken upstairs to a conference room where HR gave a speech about how great the company is. We were then assigned to a table, and given a laptop and packet describing the programming challenge. The challenge was supposed to be team-based (with the people at your table), but it turned out to be more individual that I anticipated. The problem broke into three pieces, and each person picked a part to do. You didn't have to use the same language. The parts were basically independent, but I could see where sharing code between teammates could be helpful. We were given 6 hours to complete the task. After about half an hour, an engineer came to gauge our understanding of the problem, and clarified anything we didn't know. We then worked for about an hour, and an engineer pulled each of us out for a personal "interview". It was the least personal interview I have ever had. The engineer was all business, and we just talked about my approach to the problem. When I got back, I had about 4 more hours to complete the assignment. Half an hour before the deadline, we were individually interviewed again. Pretty much the same type of thing, just talked about my approach. The interviewers were always interested in efficiency. They asked questions like "how could you make this better/faster", and "why did you use this data structure". I really got bit in the butt because I was forced to use C++, instead of C (which I am much more familiar with). I was unfamiliar with the C++ libraries, and I had to waist a lot of time looking at documentation. BIG TIP: be very familiar with your language before you go! My solution was incomplete, and I knew this when I turned in. I was encouraged to write a README file which explained my shortcomings, and any ideas I had to make the code more efficient. At the end of the interview, we had a group Q&A with a developer. I got the impression that this was a very stressful job with poor work/life balance. I love the area, so if I had gotten an offer it would have been a tough decision weather I was willing to sacrifice a stressful job for my dream city.

The questions were: 1) Given an int number in bits, format it into exactly 3 digits (with a decimal) and add a G for gigs, M for megabytes K for kilobytes and B for bytes. 2) Given two arrays of integers, create a third array with the element in each position in the first array multiplied by every element in the second array except for the element at the same index in the second array. Passed that. On to phone screen. Questions straight out of Cracking the Coding Interview (book): 1) Rotate a 2D array 90 degrees clockwise, in-place without using a second 2D array 2) Design a chat server Flew out to Amazon in Seattle: First Interview) Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, return a list of all elements that have the difference of 2 (for example 2 and 4, or 5 and 7). Second Interview) Behavioral. Tell me about the most challenging task. Hardest bug. ...Lunch break Third Interview) Given a bitmap, find the largest size of adjacent 1's. Fourth Interview) Given a sorted array, return a set of all ranges in the array. For example [0,1,2,4,6,7,8] has ranges 0-2, 4-4, and 6-8. Fifth interview) Design a furniture store.

I was called on-site for the group interview. There were 11 other fresh grads along with me for the interview. There was a short campus tour. Followed by that, they had a company presentation. And then divided us into groups of 3 to solve a real problem. Its not really a team effort, since everyone is just competing. Overall, I thought it was stressful and the people were quite arrogant.

I was recruited via Linkedin and invited to two rounds of phone interviews before being invited to an onsite interview in Seattle. Because I have signed a non-disclosure agreement so I can reveal the actual question. However, both phone interviews last about 90 min each and both have about 30 min to cover your background and career interest, about 10 min for my questions and the rest are technical questions. Technical questions aren't terribly difficult but you do have to brush up your college data structure. The real tricky part is you need to log in to an online whiteboard or you to demonstrate your coding solution. The whiteboard actually has a simplified IDE that can compile most of the common programming language. The interviewer from my second phone interview doesn't care too much about the actual compilation but the one from the first is a bit more particular on that. So if you are expecting just pseudo-coding you might be surprised. Regarding the on-site interview there are about five different sessions, each last about 50 minutes. All except one are one-on-one, the other have two interviewer. The questions can be divided into three categories 1) projects you have done before 2) behavioral questions and 3) technical questions. For category 1, they might concentrated on a certain project in your resume when going over your previous experience, so picking the right experience to prepare for interviewed will certainly help. There are plenty example online for category 2. For the technical questions, they are more or less the same as the phone interview, except you only need to do pseudo-code. They are mildly challenging and it shouldn't be overly difficult as long as you are reasonably apt at problem solving. The part I dislike the most is one of the interview session is done over lunch, so the interviewer will take me out to lunch and at the same time asking me questions. The Amazon facility in Seattle are right in downtown so my interviewer are juggling between finding the restaurant in the middle of the city, deciding what to eat and interviewing me at the same time. Even worse is a hobo came up to us on the street asking for a quarter for cup of coffee or something like that. So a lot of time the interviewer seemed to be lost in all these and I didn't feel like what I said had actually got through to him at time. Contrary to other's experience, all my interviewers do give me sufficient time to ask questions and I don't feel I was being rushed. However, it doesn't seem like they have a particular position in mind for me to fill, rather they are trying to see if I can be fit into any of their need, so I don't really have a clear idea what position I am actually apply for and thus it is hard to ask sensible questions Also they are very responsive throughout the entire interviewing process, most of the time they will get back to me within one day or two between each round.

2 phone interviews. hired based off of 30 mins of talk time and a resume you gave them. Not a ton of time to show off, but it was enough. you'll be asked some personality questions and a coding question or two. two people each with their own set of questions.

I was contacted by a recruiter via email to interview for a SDE position during a hiring event in Boston. I had an initial phone call with the recruiter, who put me in touch with a scheduler. The scheduler set me up for a phone interview, which was a live-coding interview. # Phone Interview # There were a few questions about my resume (the one they had was four years out of date!) but the majority of this interview was technical. The questions were pretty basic and focused on general algorithmic knowledge. I only remember the last task, which involved Fibonacci sequence generation. There were several steps after this that involved optimizing the solution. Once finished, the interviewer gave me a chance to ask questions about Amazon. Shortly after the phone interview, I was contacted by the team recruiter who informed me that they'd like me to come in for an on-site interview. I made a point to discuss my resume being four years out of date, but was told this would not be a problem. I was given a list of times and asked to pick a handful that worked best for me. Once that was taken care of, I was given a rundown of the position (salary range, relocation package, benefits, etc.) Onsite interview specifics were explained to me and the onsite was set to take place a couple weeks later. # Onsite Interview # A schedule was given to me a few days before the onsite interview that outlined who I'd be interviewing with (name and title,) and at what time. The format was 4 interviews at 45 minutes each, all in the same room, all technical in nature. I arrived early, and waited in the lobby for an interviewer to come meet me and take me to the interview room. Once other candidates arrived, there weren't enough chairs for everyone in the lobby, so the receptionist had to run and get some office chairs from somewhere else in the building. After waiting for a short period (maybe 20 or so minutes,) my first interviewer met me in the lobby, got me a visitor badge, and we headed over to the interview room. I won't get specific about the questions from the onsite interview (NDA, more on that later,) but I will say that they follow a basic template. First few questions are scripted behavioral questions, everything else is technical. I was required to write code for every interview (even those with managers.) All of the interviewers were explicitly *not* strict regarding syntax, with the exception of the bar raiser. I was also asked architectural and design questions. I got along well with everyone but the bar raiser, who succeeded in ruffling my feathers a bit. All of the interviews were completed with enough time for me to ask the interviewer questions except for the bar raiser, whose interview I didn't wrap up in time. Every interviewer had my outdated resume and asked me about my experience listed. This meant I had to update each about the last 4 years of my professional life (which contained directly relevant experience.) After the final interview, I was escorted to the elevators after being told multiple times that I'd hear back from someone within 3 days. Overall, the campus felt very sterile and almost prison-like. What I did see of the office was bland and unappealing (no art on the walls, nothing distinguishing peoples' desks, nothing to suggest that people even work there.) I was only ever offered water, and was at no point allowed to go anywhere without a direct escort. Throughout the interviews I did not leave the room, but was asked in between interviews if I needed to use the restroom. I was required to sign an NDA to complete the interview process, but at no point was told what it was I'd actually be working on, despite me directly asking. I was told that even other teams within the company weren't privy to what was going on. As mentioned earlier, I was told that I'd receive either an offer or rejection within 3 days. About a week passed, so I reached out to the recruiters to ask for an update. No response. It wasn't until almost a month after the onsite that I was sent a rejection. The email was pretty off-putting because it was suggested that maybe a support or systems engineering position would be a better fit for me. I was already making a downward move title-wise to the SDE position, but the change of location and project focus were appealing enough to merit that. # Overall # While every person I spoke with was personable and seemed intelligent (without coming off arrogant,) the company bothered me. Amazon seems to be devoid of a culture to the point of feeling robotic. The sterile office, scripted responses, failure to follow through on self-appointed contact deadlines, general lack of input recognition, the mildly insulting rejection quip, and some frustrating logistical blunders (which I won't get into,) all made me think that it's probably best I didn't receive an offer.

I'll respect the NDA and not go into specifics. I will say that it involved graph traversal.   Answer Question

I would like to let you all know how I feel about Amazon's hiring process. This is my experience: Situation 1: I got an email from the Hiring Manager himself and we set up an informational chat. The chat went very well and he told me that the HR will call me for the next few rounds. I waited for a month and did not get any response from them. I emailed the hiring manager 4 times but did not get any response. Finally, I wanted to set up a call with him and that's when his junior manager told me that the position had been called off. The least I expected was a mail from them! Situation 2: I got an email from a recruiter letting me know that she is interested in my resume. We set up a quick phone call and she did not call me. I waited for 30 minutes and sent her an email. She responded immediately and we had a chat. I understand that sometimes our calender' gives us trouble but what I did not like was that while she was talking to me, she was eating and having other conversations with people. I thought this was rude and Amazon needs to learn how to communicate with aspiring candidates!

Had a few phone conversations with HR about specific positions and interests. One technical phone interview with coding on a shared google-doc-like website. Flew me to Seattle and put me up in a nice hotel. Interviewed with six people back-to-back without pause for four or five hours. Each interview was roughly the same: do some whiteboard coding, answer questions about your history. None of the whiteboard questions were riddles or tricks or things with one weird solution that you probably won't come to on your own. They were just mildly thorny problems where a decent solution involves a map or two and updating data in the proper order: decent and realistic stuff. Read up on Amazon's Leadership Principles. There is a lot of "behavioral interviewing" where you're asked about challenges you've experienced and how you've responded to them. I went in expecting general questions where they'd analyze my answer to see if it exemplified specific Leadership Principles. In reality, the interviewers just straight-up asked, "tell me about a time where you <INSERT AMAZON LEADERSHIP PRINCIPAL>". Where Amazon differed from other companies is that I was not given much opportunity to ask questions of the interviewers. They told me the project is secret and that most projects at Amazon are treated as secrets, even to other employees within the company. It's a little weird not knowing 100% what you're signing up for. Also, I didn't get a good feel for the culture of the team I'd be joining. The whole process took just over a month, which is apparently faster than usual. I was fielding interviews and offers from other companies so continually pushed Amazon to keep the process moving along.

I was called for an onsite day long interview in Seattle. The interview was a group/team coding exercise. In the morning after a tour of the amazon campus in Seattle, we were divided into groups of 3 and given a laptop to work on. You could select an OS and IDE of your preference to work on. We were given a problem which had 3 tasks and each of us had to take on of them. The coding started around 11 in the morning and lasted till 4:30 in the evening. In the duration I had 2 one on one interviews, the 1st one 30 mins into the exercise and the 2nd one an hour before the turning in of our codes. The interviews focused on the approach I had decided on to solve the problems. Which data structure, any optimizations I could think of if I had more time.

The entire process was very enjoyable for me. Before the interview, I was informed on the topics they would ask so I could better prepare myself for it. I had back-to-back interviews with 45 minutes each. The interview didn't delve too much into my past experience and just went straight to the technical questions. I answered 2 questions for each interview. The questions were about data structures and algorithms, if you know the Cracking book pretty well then it should be no problem. The interviewers were nice and guided me with the right directions to answer the questions. I was given an offer a week later and was provided with very detailed information about the internship. Overall it was a very positive interviewing experience for me.

Very expected questions. For every question, you are expected to explain your approach, step through conceptually, and then write the code, step through the code, and clean up the code.

I had 5 interviews + lunch, with a mix of technical and behavioral questions. The questions were typical algorithm/data structures questions, so definitely prepare on those beforehand. The next day I got an email letting me know that they would be extending an offer. I had interviewed at a couple of other places previously which really helped my confidence. Definitely do that if possible.

A lot of behavioral questions, have some experiences memorized so you're not making it up as you go along.   Answer Question

online problems including two programming questions and twenty reasoning questions and some other Psychological Testing questions. The two programming problems are not very difficult, I think the point is the time and space used. you should be careful of time to finish the 20 reasoning questions, there are verbal reasoning questions and table data reasoning questions.

the programming questions are not very difficult. one is compute the maximum amplitude of a binary tree, the other is to choose the values of parameters to get the maximum value.   Answer Question

I didn't hear back from them for over month after I applied. So I contacted them by email to ask about the status of my application, and they replied by inviting me for an on-site interview at their Seattle campus. They didn't ask for a phone interview or talk to me before that. I thought that was weird, but cool nonetheless. As it turned out, there was a catch. The reason they don't do phone interviews is because the on-site interviews are group interviews with about 50 other candidates. And damn they are difficult. They don't have time to do phone interviews, because they are doing it mass production style. Amazon is growing at a very fast pace, and adding a lot of employees constantly, as well as replacing those who leave because of their high turn-over rate. I guess they figured this is the only way that they can hire a lot of people, yet still ensure they are only getting top quality. I would have preferred if it was one-on-one interviews. Even if I hadn't gotten an offer that way, I would have felt more respected. The interview day is comprised of one big programming project. We were given old low-end bulky laptops with small screens (14 inch?) to work on. We worked in groups of three. They constantly stressed that we were not competing with either our teammates or other groups, and that if we were all good, they would hire us all. Given the fast rate at which Amazon is growing, I believe that. I believe the programming project was too big and too time consuming for only about 5-6 hours. I think it favors people with a lot of programming experience rather than problem solving ability. Someone who can crank out a lot of simple code quickly will outperform someone who can write a small amount of really difficult code. I don't think they are necessarily getting the best quality of candidates this way. This is an entry level position, and they shouldn't have interviews more suitable for seasoned software engineers. Amazon admitted that they have a very frugal cost-conscious company culture and this is a good thing. However, I don't like that they downplayed the frequency with which employees are on-call: where they could be called in the middle of the night and have to wake up and fix a site reliability problem, albeit from their home. According to them, it was a few days every six months, but according to someone I know who worked at Amazon, it is a few days every couple of weeks.

The programming project was too big and time-consuming for completing in under 6 hours. It takes a lot of time to read and fully comprehend the long project writeup and the framework code we are supposed to build on, let alone code it, test it, and comment it.   Answer Question

Group Coding Interview I have been called for special round where people from different universities are grouped into a team size of 3. We were given three problems to work on, all of them are independent of each other and will be evaluated only on the performance of the individual. Although, they will assess our team collaboration skills. There is very less information across the web for this Group Interview and it was very difficult to predict how it going to be and prepare for it. I signed NDA so I cannot reveal the questions but I will give the best information which is not discussed elsewhere. Interview starts at 9:30 AM and you will have some info session with the dev's. You will be given the question at around 10 Am and will have a chance to pick up a task from 3 tasks assigned for the group. The panel will reach to your table at around 10:30-10:45 and will have a 15 min Q&A session on your approach. You will have the chance to code for until 2:00 PM, after which you need to report to the panel about your status for about 15 minutes. Later, 30 min interview very relevant to the coding exercise and a final 15 min session. You need to wrap up things by around 4:30-5 PM. Ultimately, you will be left with 4 - 4:30 hour for the coding exercise. The tasks were not very difficult, you need to think how you can code the solution in 4 hours. It is very important to come up with some working solution rather than a fancy one. I almost came up with a very elegant OO code but failed to finish and make it run. I complicated myself, so are others. I could hardly see anyone turning up a solution. Advice: Prepare well with the data structures, advanced ones like interval trees etc. Have good knowledge about algorithms like Bellman ford, Knapsack and many more.etc. No need to stress on Design Patterns. Collaborate well with the team. Practice some coding challenges which can be solved in 3-4 hours (Most Important). It is all about your thinking process and the speed,accuracy with which you can code. Enjoy Seattle !

Got contacted by a recruiter. They flew me out the next week to do a group interview where I coded on a three piece project. Each individual in the team works on a portion of the project, but you work as a team to develop the entire concept of the program. Total of 7 hours with about 5 hours of interviewing. Meanwhile a group of 4 amazon employees are watching you and eventually you get a one-on-one interview to discuss the current implementation of your code.

Got an email saying I had to give 2 tech interviews of an hour each very next day. It said the tech will mainly be on data structure, algorithms and OOPS. First interviews was a woman who was really nice and friendly. Asked me about my resume first then told that I had to code a few questions she asked. 1) Design a Singleton Class 2) Write an least complex alto to find the first least appearing letter in a given string. 3)I don't remember this question. Second interviewer was straight to the point. As i picked up the phone he told me to open my email as he had sent a link to collabedit.com where I had to code. 1) Check whether two given binary trees are of identical(same depth and same values) 2) Given a log file which consists of timestamp, customer ID, page id visited by that particular customer. Write a function to return all customers who have visited 5 unique pages in last 30 mins.............And yes I dint get this code and entire interview got over in this question....... I got 4 out of 5 programs asked in 2 interviews, I was not expecting to get selected as Amazon has very high standards but one morning got an email saying Amazon is extending internship offer to me. Advice : Don't lose hope even if you don't know the exact code, let the interviewer know what thinking process is going on in ur brain. Big companies want people who can think.

I don't remember how I applied, but remember that Amazon contacted me by email. First step was an informal interview with one of the team members, followed by 5 formal interviews. What's the difference between formal and informal? I didn't quite understand. The interviewers were nice, tasks were well formulated with some exceptions. Mostly trivial algorithms. For all questions involving algorithms I first implemented the task using the most-trivial, least-efficient method, told the interviewer the current complexity and then incrementally improved the algorithm for efficiency. I'd recommend you the same as it gives you the time to analyse the task and have some basis for improvement. Didn't solve 2 tasks and was asked to send the solutions immediately after the interview. And I sent. After a week I got a phone call telling me about an offer.

My resume was submitted through an employee referral and I was invited for an on-site interview at the Amazon Campus in Seattle for a group interview. There was no previous phone screening in my case. We were randomly distributed into 3-person teams and everyone was presented with 3 different problems. The Amazon interviewers and current developers present there mentioned that the problems were simplified versions of real issues that Amazon was dealing with. In our team we had to come to an agreement as to which interviewee would take on which problem. After that, you were pretty much on your own to solve the problem. Each interviewee was given a laptop and there were a variety of programming languages and IDEs available and even an Ubuntu VM. I chose Java, NetBeans, and Windows. You should really choose what you are most comfortable with; don't try to improvise there. Unlike white boards interviews, here you had to get an actual program working, pseudo code would not cut it. On the other hand, you had plenty of time to think about your solution, which is not really the case in other 1 on 1 interviews. Common online resources were available (Google, StackOverflow), you just were not allowed to access personal repositories (Dropbox, etc). Every two hours you would stop coding and would explain your thought process to an interviewer for about 30 minutes, analyzing your approach, your reasoning and what you could do to improve your solution. Even if you have no time for a more carefully optimized solution, you should be able to explain in a detailed manner how you would proceed if you had more time and resources (like a database) and why. Your data structure choices and how to use them was very important in order to provide a working source code solution. Be ready to go through the cons of each decision and think about scalability. Overall, this wasn't a hard interview at all.

There was nothing really unexpected or any unfair questions. I believe the interview was designed to emulate a normal day at Amazon, with all the resources you would have available, being able to discuss your approach with a small team, distributing work and at the end taking on your own responsibility.   Answer Question

I gave a recruiter my resume at my university's career fair and got an email about 2 weeks later inviting me to an on-site interview in Seattle. I was really surprised that I didn't have any phone interviews, not even an initial phone screen before being invited on-site (nobody from Amazon called me at all). I live in California, so going to the campus wasn't just a drive away. At my on-site interview, we were put into groups of 3 to complete a mini programming project that was supposedly based on problems that real Amazon engineers consider (but to a much smaller scale). Each project is independently done. That's what we worked on for the whole day, and throughout the day, you would get pulled out for short interviews mostly explaining what you're doing on the project and related things. Nothing really behavioral or technical. The interviewers were friendly and helpful. Afterwards, all the interviewees went into a room for some panel discussion and questions. Overall, I had a good experience on-site, but it was very different from what I expected or have experienced before. One thing though, it's been over a month since I submitted my reimbursements and still haven't gotten a reimbursement or update.

I applied to Amazon.com online and received an invitation to interview at their HQ in Seattle ~1 week later. Amazon buys your flight and hotel, but they also reimburse for any expenses aside from alcohol, etc. (it's worth going at least to have fun in Seattle!) The interview process was grueling. They have you code from ~10AM - 4:30 PM on a project. The project is divided into smaller subsections (usually 3) where you work with 2 other people to understand the project's concept, then go off and work on your own part. You meet with two interviewers -- one for 30 minutes, another for 15. These interviews are broken up throughout the day, but you mostly just code on your section of the project. The interview questions are relevant to CS, software design, your code, and how well you understand the project and other people's sections of the project. By the end of the day I was ready to run out of their office and head to the corner bar.

None of the questions were difficult. The only 'difficult' question I had was "How would you approach this problem with a better solution?"   1 Answer

I interviewed with Amazon for a Summer Internship. The process took less than 3 weeks. I had two back-to-back 45 minute phone-interviews scheduled. Within a week I was informed of the decision. The questions were of average difficulty. They were mostly looking for strong Computer Science fundamentals. The first interviewer was interested in details of one of my projects. He then moved on to asking me a few fundamental questions about inheritance. The coding problem involved merging two unsorted strings. The interviewer was also interested in questioning me on how the code would scale if the strings grow to large. The second interview was more grilling, the interviewer gave me a situation where a web server not performing as expected and wanted me to dive deep into deciphering what all could have gone wrong. I was then asked to implement 'toString' Java API.

I got contacted via Linked In by a recruiter. The recruiter was always very nice and very helpful; the recruiting people gave me advises and told me what to expect in the interviews and what topics to study, it felt like they were kind of on my side and wanted to help me succeed in the interviews. I first got a phone technical interview that lasted about 30 minutes. They asked me some general data structures questions and then we used ColabEdit for coding; I just got one single coding problem to solve, they asked me to write function to efficiently look for all the phone numbers from a list A that were part of a list B (I solved it by using a Hash Table and my interviewer was happy with the solution). Then I got a second phone interview. The second interview was very similar to the first one; I got some data structures and algorithms questions and then they gave me another coding problem to solve on ColabEdit, they asked me to write a function that would receive the root of a binary tree as input parameter and would restructure the tree so that the final result was the same tree but vertically mirrored. I wrote a function and my interviewer was happy with it. After the two phone interviews, they asked me to fly to Seattle for the final round of interviews that last the whole day. They put me in a nice hotel and payed for all the expenses. I got 5 interviews in total, each one lasting about 1 hour. First onsite interview: They asked me general questions and asked me to describe some of my past projects; then asked me to design and code a Cache system. They told me they didn't know the right answer and they just wanted to see what I would come up with, they participated in the design suggesting things and asking questions. Second onsite interview: They asked me to create an algorithm to find all the strongly connected components of a graph (very though question in my opinion). Lucky me I had studied some graphs theory and I was able to remember Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components. I reproduced the algorithm from what I remembered and I think I did it right (although some times the interviewers are more interested in seeing how you approach a problem rather than knowing the solution, so not sure if knowing the answer played against me). Third onsite interview: One of the amazon guys took me out for lunch to a place neat place near amazon and we just chatted and towards the end of the interview he started asking me some behavioral questions. Fourth onsite interview: On this one I interviewed with a PM and a leader from one of the Amazon teams. The Amazon team lead asked me to design an eCommers website. I think I struggled a little bit with this one because I was not prepared for architectural questions or designed, I kind of just focused on algorithms. Fifth onsite interview: The last guy just asked me to write some easy code to perform some task that I forgot, but it was very easy. In all the 5 interviews they all asked me behavioral questions related to the Amazon Values (study the Amazon Values, this is extremely important for them). Although I struggled in the third onsite interview, I really felt like my overall performance had been great and I thought I was going to get an offer; but at the end they didn't extend an offer. I asked for some feedback to know what areas I was weak to work on them but they told me that they cannot provide feedback because of their policies.

These include a detailed discussion on my experience and specifics on projects I worked on (be ready to explain what you did, how, and why you did it), as well as some coding. Amazon seems very interested in understanding the complexity of your work and how versed you are in sharing those experiences. After these interviews, I was scheduled for an onsite interview at the Seattle HQ. Amazon puts you in contact with a travel desk that arranges your flight and accommodations for you. Feel confident in asking for flights/airlines or other requests you may have, as they are friendly and will try to get what you ask for. Amazon flies you a day before the interview and puts you on a very nice hotel 10 min away from the office. Onsite interview day included five 1:1 interviews, including two development managers and three SDEs, focusing on different areas. You are received by your recruiter and have a 30 min chat with him. You get some details on what to expect during the day, and the days after the interview. Most interviewers will be writing notes while you chat (they ask if you're ok with it - I wonder if you say no, what happens?!). Questions include behavioral and technical, as well as coding on a whiteboard. Interviewers are friendly and help you through the process - ask for what are you thinking and give you hints in case they see you getting stuck. The best way to easy the nerves is to keep talking as you tackle problems. It helps more than what you think. I heard back from my recruiter after 2 days saying the team wanted to move forward and extend an offer. A couple days after I got the details of it and after some light negotiation I accepted. My advise is to avoid focusing too much on the horror stories you find online, and just make the experience your own. It is unlikely you'll get something like you have read here. It will be unique and a good learning experience, whatever the outcome is. Just try to enjoy it as much as you can and please, don't go into it without serious preparation before hand. Even if you don't make it you want to give a good impression, and of course, avoid post-interview "what if I have..." thoughts.

I cannot disclose specific questions due to NDA. However, just get ready and feel comfortable with basic CS (algorithms, data structures, OO design). Make sure you can cleanly write code for simple, well-known problems, and that you can explain in few words these concepts.   Answer Question

I was selected for a phone interview, scheduled time away from my current job to fulfill a one hour time slot away from the office I drove to work 45 minutes away instead of busing so that I could leave for the interview mid-day. After 15 minutes of waiting for the call at a Starbucks, I emailed the person who scheduled the interview about the delay. an additional 30 minutes later, I called her and was informed that there was a last minute reason they had to postpone the interview and I would hear from them later that week. Despite my attempts to follow up, I never heard from them again. I can understand not being selected, but I can't understand that they wouldn't let me know early enough for me to avoid wasting so much time.

The most difficult question was mine: I can understand not being selected, but I can't understand that they wouldn't let me know early enough for me to avoid wasting so much time. Why would you schedule me for an interview, then lose interest in me and not even let me know but rather just not show up? If I did the same, I would probably be blacklisted by your company!   Answer Question

After an online application, I was contacted by a technical recruiter who set up an appointment with a team member for a phone technical interview. The interviewer asked brief questions about my background and then proceeded with the tecnical questions. The technical question was regarding binary search trees. The binary search tree duplicate keys identification and management were the main topics of the interview. The other question was about how to find and validate a tree as a BST given a range of input parameters.

I was contacted by a recruiter to join an all-day group interview. During the interview day, I joined the short tour. Then we were divided into groups each has 3 people, and we have 4 groups in a room with 3 or 4 interviewers. They send out the problem description. There are 3 problems and 1 to 2 pages of description for each problem. After reading the description, each person chose the problem to solve. There is no obvious difference on the difficulty among the problems. So choose the one that you feel most comfortable to solve. If you have conflict with your teammates, I think it's the best time to show your leadership. We had the brief lunch in the same room while coding. During the interview, an interviewer will take you to another room to have an individual talk. They mostly ask you questions about your thoughts and solutions for the problem you are doing. And sometimes they may ask your understanding of the other two problems which your teammates are working on. My suggestion is that don't be panic about the long problem description. Talk to your teammates or interviewers to improve understanding. Start coding until you have a thorough understanding. Solution may not be perfect, but you should at least implement a brute force version and know how to optimize it.

A recruiter contacted me after seeing my profile on linkedin. After a screening phone interview with the recruiter they set-up a 75-minute technical phone interview with one of their SDEs. They set-up a collabnet session where you had to write code on-the-fly. After a brief discussion about my work history, he asked 3 questions: 1. tell me what you know about binary search trees. 2. write method which takes a tree node and returns true/false if it is a bst. 3. write a method which takes an array of ints and an int value, and return all pairs of values from the array that add up to the value.

Two back-to-back 45 minute interviews with just an Amazonian and I (in adjacent rooms, another student and I just swapped places. First one was pretty relaxed, talked about data structures, what he did at Amazon, he asked me a couple simple fast questions typical of a intro CS class exam, and an OO design question. Next person asked me a long question that took me about 40 minutes to complete, and we talked a bit about what she did. I had another offer deadline imminent, so they got back to me with an offer on that Monday (the interview was Friday). Very fast and surprisingly simple process, I'm still surprised that there was really only one (kind of two) interviews. Good experience!

My interview fell on a snow day so I don't know if this is standard but the interviews were over the phone on collabedit. When I was at work my manager conducted similar phone screen interviews. But full time interviews required an on site white board thing.

Amazon attends the career fair at our University every semester and the have a couple of interview with a few selected candidates and if they pass they are invited to Seattle. This time I instead got a email to take the programming challenge. A weeks time was given to submit the code. The challenge itself was for 2 hours. It had three questions and all you had to do is write the code (there is no compilation), explain it and also add relevant comments. The questions weren't extraordinarily tough or anything. If you have sound logic and a good grasp of data structures you should be okay. 2 weeks later I got an email to attend an onsite interview. The whole process of scheduling a onsite took almost a month. I've heard that it usually doesn't take that long but they probably had many people interviewing. I flew out on a Thursday and was accommodated in a nice hotel quite close to the headquarters. The interview was scheduled to begin at 12:00PM. I made my way to the office and after all of us who had interviews assembled (around 40) we were given temp IDs and taken to a large room with many tables. They asked us to sit in groups of 4 at a table and grab a bite to eat. In a few minutes our interviewers came and joined and everyone had a nice informal chat. After half an hour, names of interviewers and and those people who they will interview were called out. We were taken to our respective rooms and the interview started. As is with many other reviews here, I am not at liberty to disclose what they asked me during the interview. But make sure that you have spent time sitting and writing code by hand on paper or better yet, on a whiteboard. Cracking the coding interview was the only thing I referred to. Solve the book yourself and towards the last chapters you'll realize that breaking down difficult problem comes naturally. I had four back to back interviews. All technical with quite a large amount of coding involved. There were a few random HR questions but mainly coding. There were 2-4 programming questions in each round. One has to explain the logic, write the code and explain his/her logic, prove that the code works run test cases and be ready to tell him/her/them how you would scale that code up in case they ask you. There was no pre defined level to the order of difficulty, I found the first three equally intensive and the fourth one very hard. More stress cannot be laid on the following fact - "Strict proper coding is of paramount importance". Just scribbling stuff, writing algorithms will not help you. You are expected to know your stuff. Proper function definitons, variable names, pointer usage (if c/c++). When you test your function make sure that you have thought about EVERY SINGLE edge case under the Sun. You might think that you have covered them all but beware. If I say every possibilty under the sun, I mean under the Sun not only on Earth but also under the sun on Jupiter, Saturn, moon etc. I got stuck at a point where I didn't even have a single line of code on the board. The interviewer did give me a hint after a couple of requests. But be sure that you have thought out (aloud) every other possibility. There is no greater sin that not knowing what space and time complexities are and how to figure out what they are for the algorithm you have come up with. We were done by 5 in the evening on a Friday and I had the offer on Monday. Good luck to anyone reading this!

I had applied several times through Amazon's career page but never heard back using that method. I obtained a recruiter's Amazon email through my University's career adviser and sent out an email explaining my love for Amazon as a company, and genuine desire to be a part of the expanding giant. I heard back two days later, was quickly invited to two back-to-back 45-minute phone interviews scheduled one week after I had first sent out the email. This all just happened today. Will update as I move along in the process.

The interviews were very technically oriented thankfully. There were no behavioral questions besides the usual: "Why do you want to work with Amazon?" I was given only one problem in every interview, which surprisingly takes the greater part of the interview to solve. We communicated using CollabEdit.com. Question Number 1: //Write a method which takes an array input and returns true if the sum of any two elements is equal to the sum of the corresponding indices. // Concretely if for an array the sum of values at any two indices i and j is equal to the sum of i and j.

I applied for Amazon through my school's career website as well as Amazon's website. I got an invite for on-campus interviews later on in the month. The first interview was an initial screening. The interview was very informal and simple, and that night I got a phone call asking me to go back for three more interviews the next morning. The three next interviews were back to back. The questions asked involved algorithms, data structures and design problems; nothing that was particularly tricky. All the interviewers seem to like the company, but none of them seem to love it. I got an email offer 2 days after those interviews, and I was also invited to fly to Amazon for a day trip, where I met some of the teams at Amazon and chatted with some engineers. The trip was interesting and I enjoyed it. However, I eventually decided to decline the offer because I don't think I was particularly passionate about any of the teams. Before you go to an Amazon interview, be warned that they will give you an offer very quickly. If you have other companies that you have in mind that you would like to consider, you should set up interviews with them first. I know a lot of people (including myself) who got an unexpectedly early offer from Amazon before they were even contacted by other companies they might like.

Applied for the Silk team via their website. Got a call within 2 weeks. There were a few clashes in the dates as my wife was going to deliver during that period, but they very kindly rescheduled. I had 2 phone screens and was then called to Seattle for full-day interviews. Phone screen was done using collabedit tool, and on-site interview required writing code on white-board. 1st Phone screen: Write a power function. All edge cases like overflow, different values of powers (+ve, -ve, zero) need to be handled. Have to give most efficient solutions. 2nd Phone screen: Write a function that, given an array and a number as input, finds all pairs in the array that add up to that number. Number can be +ve/-ve. Write most space (or) time efficient algorithm. How will it handle duplicate pairs. On-site interviews: 1. Given a 2D array (which has initially all false values), fill it up with 'X' true values placed randomly in it (like minesweeper game). Most efficient alog expected with handling of ALL edge cases. 2. Implement a simple contacts application in which one can search via First name. Most efficient alog expected with handling of ALL edge cases. 3. Bar-raiser: Given a log file from a website which contains the user ID and the accessed URL, find the TOP "sequence" of 3 urls amongst ALL visitors of the website. The sequence of urls have to be in sequence as they are accessed. 4. Experience related questions by Team manager over lunch. 5. Implement classes for a website that can be used for building your own computer. Eg: If a user selects a motherboard, it should filter out all the incompatible CPUs etc. You have to implement various classes that can be used for implementing this functionality.

I submitted my resume in a school job fair and got reject. But, HR man emailed me to invite the final on-site interview. In the interview, I met 2 teammates and got one task each. While solving the task, we needed to meet 4 interviews to talk about the task I was doing. To solve my question, I need to use Map. I got rejected from the interview. I think my way to use Map is not good as other members.

Got in contact through college career fair. Had a 45min on-campus interview 3 weeks later. The interviewer was very friendly, he gave helpful hints on how to solve the coding problems. He walked me through my code and pointed out where needs improvements. Some problems he asked were: Given an integer array, find any integer that occurs more than once. Given a binary tree, test whether it is a BST. Given two random nodes in a tree, not necessarily a BST, find their common parent. They really focus on memory usage and time complexity of your algorithm/data structure.

1. Contacted by a recruiter out of nowhere 2. Took an online assessment test It has 3 questions. Detect and remove loop in linked list, calculate first five highest averages and return as a Map and the other I forgot. Make sure to write code without errors and mention comments for the code in detail. 3. I passed the online test and was invited for onsite interview. As I walked into the lobby, I found 40 people waiting to be interviewed. It was horrible. Everyone had four rounds of interviews, each 45 minutes and it included lunch with the interviewers. Questions are straight from Cracking the code interview. How to print a tree in level odder with each level in new line, a hash map problem which was easy, modifications to hash maps, how to find if a a graph is 2-colorable or not? Code it. I did well on all questions, analyzed runtimes and was happy about how the 4 rounds went. 4. After 2 weeks I received a rejection. I expected this because out of 40, they had to pick about 10. Many of them interned at Amazon before or had at least 2-3 years of experience. It was relative and I didn't feel bad about it.

I applied for back around the end of 2012. I got an email a few weeks later from a recruiter scheduling a technical phone interview with me at a certain time on a certain day. When the day and time came, I waited for 20 minutes and they never called or contacted me in any form. I sent them an email saying that I never got contacted by the interviewer, and I didn't get a response until nearly 24 hours later. I find this to be unprofessional, and when we tried to reschedule it, they said that a lot of the employees wouldn't be around during the time. At this time, I also had a job offer that I had really wanted, so I declined any other interviews/interview attempts with them.

They asked about the most difficult problem I had to solve in my past jobs, this was a difficult questions because I did not work on projects that are as complex as Amazon's systems and finding an impressive problem was very hard for me.

Recruiter scheduled the interview. - First round of interview. All high level development and design questions and description of experiences, challenges in job , and 1 online algorithmic coding session. All went well. -Selected for second round of interview. 1 online algorithmic coding session. Solved it recursively. Interviewer asked to do it iteratively. Solved it iteratively as well. Run time complexity was o(n). Have been asked to make it more efficient if possible. I was a bit confused. So, interview provider hints and I got what he was asking for. I explained him and he was satisfied. He, kind of provided hints positively to be ready for the next round. I assumed final onsite interview. So was preparing for it. :) After few days, Recruiter sent email that the team decided to go with another candidate. What the heck! Second round of interview was better than first round. Despite better performance, still not selected. Really Discouraging. Now don't even want to think of joining Amazon, I deserve Google. :)

Program to find the longest common subsequence (in a sequence)   Answer Question

May 25, 2013

I applied online and was contacted by a University recruiter. I had to do a small programming test online (about 90 minutes). It was simple, and you could do your programming in Java or C++. With this online assessment was the usual personality test that comes with job applications. I did not have a phone interview and was invited in about a month later for what I call "Interview Day". Since I live in Seattle, they didn't offer to put me up anywhere, but I know they will fly you out to Seattle and set you up in a Hotel as part of the process. Interview Day is essentially a series of 4-5 interviews, each lasting about 45 minutes. About 10 minutes consists of talking about what they do and asking you about yourself. The remaining time is spent answering technical algorithm questions. While I am not allowed to discuss the questions they asked in detail due to a non-disclosure agreement, my best advice would be to know your algorithms. If you're in school, I highly recommend taking a high division (400-level or equivalent) algorithms course, as it was exceedingly helpful to me. Two of the questions I was asked were questions I had been asked inside that course. Know time and space complexity, dynamic programming, and recursive programming inside and out. As long as you know your stuff (that means study), you will do great. Also, I feel like half of the interview is about culture. They are trying to test your knowledge AND determine if you fit in with the culture of Amazon. What I mean by this is: 1. Be yourself. Don't suck up. This doesn't mean be rude or don't be polite to your interviewers, this just means you don't have to go with a "Yes, sir/No, sir" attitude. 2. Don't wear a suit. They don't do that at Amazon. Wear jeans. Don't worry about shaving your beard off for the interview. 3. Talk to them about what they do. They are programmers too. If you express interest, and hopefully some prior knowledge in their area of work, that will probably stick with them when decision time rolls around. So, in short, know your stuff, be yourself, and be calm. The interviewers are programmers too, they're not scary. My interview was on a Friday, and I was offered the job the following Monday.

2 independent phone interviews Interview 1: Started the interview asking me about the most challenging problem I have solved(technically) in the recent past. Define graphs, trees, BTrees, BSTrees etc. Applications of each of these. Questions like "Which data structure would you use when...". Questions based on multi-threading in java, questions on how Hash maps work internally, concurrent hash maps and hash tables. Coding question: Check if two binary trees are equal. I did it recursively, he asked me do it iteratively. Complexity and all that. Interview 2: This interview also started with the most challenging problem I have solved(technically) in the recent past. Then asked me to WAP to find the Nth Fib number(I was bewildered! Amazon, really?) Wrote the iterative version of the first ever program I learnt in my life. Asked me why I am not doing it recursively(was more than happy to answer.) He then asked me to find the nth prime in the least number of iterations(used the square root rule for reducing the number of comparisons). He tweaked around the same question like what would you do if want to find primes between two numbers. Complexity and all that. Given a set of billion numbers, how would you pick the biggest million numbers? When do u use hashes and how different is it from encryption? (Oh yea!). Some basic questions on patterns. OOPS question- Design a Zoo Suggestions: All they look for is how you can explain things in the easiest way. Before starting to code, ask him as many questions as you can(Like what complexity you looking at? Space? Iterative or recursive? Should the function return anything at all?). This is how functions looked in the first interview. Contract: Tree Tree -> Boolean Description: This function takes two Binary trees and checks for equality Example: 1 1 -> True 2 3 2 3 2 2 -> False 3 4 3 5 Strategy: General recursion Function definition: public boolean areThetEqual(Tree t1, Tree t2){ ... } Tests: Check all boundary cases. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When it's your turn to ask him questions, ask him some really relevant questions.

Five hours interview. Four interviewer all come from the same group. Each of them charge one round. There will have two questions each round, the first one is simple and the next one will be improve/refine the problem before. I believe if you are a bachelor always work with normal algorithms and data structures you will feel quite comfortable with this kind of interview. Graduate student is not necessary in this position. They only focus on your basic capability. I am graduate student and the intervire shcedule is not a good time for me. I perpare two days for this interview after my 3 final projects, I meet a issue when I hit the third round and ask for a hint, so i think I am not the perfect candidate in that group. I found that when they ask me to talk about my projrcts I feel that they are not that kind of "research guys". So again I think they are placing the emphasis on the basic capability...

Scheduled two, 45 min interviews on campus. First 45-min interview was not bad. The usual "tell me about yourself" question, followed by a series of questions describing data structures. Finally, had to implement a Version parser using simple functions. Second interview was required finding the first two numbers that add to a total in the array. Use the largest indexes. Overall not too difficult

There were two interviews, both with actual software engineers at Amazon. The first one wasn't too scary; the interviewer even asked which topic of data structures I felt most comfortable with. And so he asked a question in that area. Normally, they ask 2-3 questions in one interview, but I only got through one question. The second interview was a little tougher, and it was an actual coding problem which I had to complete on a blackboard, Definitely know your Data Structures, and go over those Acing Programming Interview books.

It was a specific sorting question about sorting certain chunks in an array. I had to write it out and then the efficiency of the program was asked as well.   Answer Question

Initial contact was a phone interview by the team manager focused on experience, with a followup technical phone interview with another member of the team that included some specific code questions. After passing those, I was flown to the headquarters in Seattle for a full day interview with seven different employees, each interviewing me one-on-one for about 45 minutes. The employees were from various teams within Amazon, some were technical, and some were managers. Each had a slightly different slant, from whiteboard algorithm coding to cultural fit.

I can't say much, because I'm still at the second step of the process. I just received am email telling me that I need to schedule the second interview. So here is my experience with the first phone interview. The interviewer started by giving me some information about his work and his devision, then I asked me to talk about my background and some of the projects that I was involved in. Surprisingly, the man was very friendly and he gave me all the time I needed to express myself and I was speaking to him I could hear him typing something on the keyboard (most probably comments). Then he said I'm going to ask you some conceptual questions. He showered me, if I may say, with questions about polymorphisms, passing values by variables vs actual values, sorting algorithms, binary search trees and their efficiency in terms of time and space. In general I answered them mostly right, but he grilled me a little bit in the explanation of the binary tree searching algorithms to the point I thought I just blew the interview off. After that he asked to write a code using an online editor where he can see what I write listen to me walk him through the code. He asked to write a code to find the intersection between to lists. I made my assumptions that these lists are integers saved in arrays and he said OK. I wrote the code under pressure, but as I was moving through I kept creating methods and consider optimum solution. I guess that's what got me to the second interview (my programming skills not my knowledge about binary search trees complexity. I'm waiting for the second interview and I will definitely share my experience here after it is done.

I was approached by a recruiter who then sent my resume over to the Hiring dept. They were prompt and scheduled the interview within a week. There were 4 technical rounds and 1 with HR. All the interviewees were personable and friendly. A lot of the questions involved coding. They walked me through many of the problems and asked questions as I was coding. They wanted to understand my thought process. If I strayed or did something wrong, they'd ask questions to indicate it. Fairly standard questions on algorithms. Definitely prepare for graph, tree algorithms, data structures and be prepared to justify a choice for a data structure. The interviewers didn't particularly care about syntax, but they want to see that you are comfortable putting pen to paper. Also be prepared with atleast 5-6 questions you want to ask them. I ran out of these and it became awkward towards the end!

Best way to get your foot in the door is to send your resume to a recruiter. Was a little frustrated that for the first phone interview, they ended up not calling and had to reschedule a month later. The interview itself was straight-forward, no-frills, coding questions. Used a website that allows the interviewer to see code that you type up. Still in the process of interviewing.

As one author put it, Amazon loves Object-Oriented Questions. It seems like the interviewers are more concerned with the process and quality of code over the number of questions you're able to answer, although I'm sure a good balance of both is useful.   Answer Question

First there was a email for you to choose you available interview schedule. I chose a date about three weeks after receiving that email to get fully prepared. There are two phone interview with 45 mins each and a 15 mins break in the middle. First interviewer asked me two questions: 1. Find the only one duplicated number in an array. The idea is easy: using hashtable. 2. Print the Fibonacci sequence until current number is bigger than a MAX value. My idea is to use a while loop until meet the condition. Also there were some concepts about Java generics and Java multi-threading. The second interviewer only asked me one big question: find the longest repeated substring in a string.(e.g., "banana" -> "ana"; "I am what I am" -> "I am"). This is little tricky one and I didn't have ideas in the beginning. But I figured it out gradually with a O(n2) algorithm after he push me to speak what am I thinking. During the coding, he found some bugs and I fixed one by one. At last the codes ran perfectly. I got the offer exactly two weeks later.

Started with two phone interviews, mostly algorithmic questions plus one design question. Then an onsite interview with 4 member of the team I would join in addition to one outsider. I did well on the interviews. For a couple of them I finished the main question quickly and the interviewer had to come up with additional questions for the remaining time. However, later the recruiter called me and asked about my visa sponsorship requirement and export control license (I needed both). Finally I was told that Amazon has recently decided not to hire nationals of certain countries (including Iran) because it provides cloud services to the government. So unfortunately I couldn't get the job.

Did a half day onsite. They never collected my NDA and didn't seem interested in it, so I guess I can feel freer to talk about it. Met with a couple of managers who clearly hated me on sight. I felt I did a good job answering the questions, however, they pretended they didn't understand. They never made eye contact, kept their arms folded, focused on other things while I worked at the whiteboard. Didn't pay attention at all. I stood there for a while, while the guy read his email, then he snapped out of it and began fault finding and displaying a general attitude of contempt. (note: I am an unattractive older American female, so it sure felt prejudicial, but who knows, maybe they are that way with everyone) Be careful, they will ask you about what you did at former companies. Always always say that you can't discuss it, no matter how cool or interesting it was. They are testing you to see if you will give away company secrets.

I was contacted by a recruiter for FBA team and asked me to fly in for onsite interview. On the day of the interview, I was taken to a room and said whole of my interview process will be dealt in the same room. First interview was with the director of the team. Basic questions on string, but I was very much surprised by the authoritative manner expressed by him. He was not ready to hear what I tried to explain nor tried to understand. So in the mid of interview process I almost lost interest. I was not given time to rewrite the code, as we mostly don't get optimized solution at first go. I did (int)c - 97 to get the ascii value of a character from a to z and mapping it to 0-25, which took him by surprise and asked why i dint use toascii. Second interview was with some manager. It was an easy question. though i coded it, i din come up with a solution which is common as it dint strike me. It was my fault. and there was a design question, but not enough time. Third interview was with senior developer. It was a system design question. It went pretty well. I was able to answer and come up with solutions. Fourth interview was with a developer. This guy also showed his attitude. Though the question was pretty simple, I made an error which i immediately rectified. Also I must say got a nervous. It was 3 hours long interview with no break in middle except for water or coffee.

I applied online and got contacted roughly 2 weeks later. The first interview was a technical interview in which I was asked one question to implement a function that required recursion. I was a bit rusty on recursion so I struggled with it, but the interviewer gave me tips and was helpful and I eventually got the solution. I thought due to my struggles that I would simply be brushed off from that point. However, I was surprised to see that I passed and moved on to the next stage. The second interview was two weeks later, in which the interviewer didn't call and it had to be rescheduled. At the rescheduled interviewed, the interviewer had a thick accent and explained the function that she wanted me to code. Throughout the interview her tone of voice generally sounded depressed or bored and she didn't really offer any positive acknowledgements like the first interviewer. I finished the function but got it wrong since I mistaken what she wanted probably due to her accent, but quickly fixed it to be what it was supposed to be within 30 seconds. I found out a week later that they're going to pursue other candidates. Overall, the first interviewer was clean, concise, and helpful in what he wanted me to do, even though I struggled I passed the first phase. The second interviewer seemed as though she wasn't as organized (missed first scheduled interview, really did not explain the question clearly - the first interviewer copy pasted an exact description of the function + examples, whereas she manually typed in some examples while trying to explain it), and clearly was not excited or enthused about her job (or maybe the interviewing portion of it).

I saw amazon at UCSD career fair (DECAF). I talked to an engineer and he asked me to describe round robin. I answered the questions and a week later I got a request to do a phone interview. The first phone interview went well. The interviewer asked me an algorithm question regarding finding duplicates in a list. He had me write it out on paper. When I was done, I read him the code (in java). Basically I used a hashmap to store values in the list, if a duplicate was found the value in the map was increased upon entry. It was pretty straight forward. There was one other restriction but I can't remember. (sorry) The second phone interview was with a senior level engineer. He asked much more difficult questions and didn't allow much time to process the question or do the alogrithms. The coding was done via an online collaboration tool. He wrote some method headers and I filled them in. He really was pushing the pace, wouldn't let me think much about the problems.

None of the questions were difficult. First interview question was about an array and finding all pair values that add up to a target number. Second question was, given an array, find as many permutations as possible in randomly ordering the array.   Answer Question

First Amazon came to my school's career fair, and I spoke with one of their representatives. They asked me a simple question on how to find the second biggest number on a unsorted list and I had to code that as well. Then about 2 months later, I got an invite to their HQ for an onsite interview, and they paid for everything. There were a bunch of people interviewing with them as well. Each of us get four individual 1:1 interviews. Each interviewer is from a different department at Amazon. All of them are technical, and I had to code on a white board for each one of them. They also asked some small questions along with the coding questions for each one of them. Most of them are pretty easy. They said I should get a response within a week, but I didn't, so I emailed them after 1.5 weeks. Then they rejected me and didn't really tell me a reason. I thought I did pretty well. All the interviewers are nice and the experience was pretty good. Seattle is indeed a nice city. I just wish I had gotten the offer.

Applied online, emailed me back after a couple of months. I took an online assessment, then they flew me out for an on-site interview. The interview lasted about 3 hours and consisted of 4-5 people. Questions: -Given two arrays of integers, find matches. -Find path in tree that sums up to desired value, first complete path, then partial path. -Head to tail problem - given a word (such as head) and a target word (such as tail) find if a path of words exists from source word to target word where each step is a new word created by changing one letter in the previous step. (head->heal->teal->tell->tall->tail) -Given a square array of letters, find all english words in the left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and north-east directions. -Convert integer to roman numeral I choked on more than one.. mostly due to pressure I think. Walking back to the hotel, I thought of many better answers. As far as the company goes, lots of young people, lots of dogs, really cool building, and relaxed atmosphere. Seattle is a great city, and it seemed like a nice place to work.

The head to tail problem was rather difficult for me... first I created a function to generate all words created by changing one letter of a word, then I mentioned doing iterative deepening DFS. Probably should have gone with A* search, with number of different letters as the heuristic... maybe keep a list of explored words to avoid duplicates.   1 Answer

They were recruiting from my University. I submitted my resume online on Wednesday. Thursday they emailed me to set up an interview for Tuesday morning. Tuesday night they emailed me to setup 3 more interviews on Thursday. Friday I was notified I had been selected to receive a full time offer. The recruiter was a little flaky after that, missing phone appointments. Eventually he followed through and set me up with a weekend trip to Seattle to meet some potential teams. The interviews were mostly technical. Each one was 45 minutes. Each one asked two programming questions and a couple personality type small talk questions. "Why did you choose to study computer science," "what's your favorite/least favorite thing about school." I don't recall any behavior questions, you know the kind, "tell me about a time you failed miserably at something and everyone laughed at you." Only one of the interviewers tried to make me write compileable code. I tried my best, but reminded how valuable a good IDE is. Know your algorithms and their big-o. Know how to find test cases. Know recursion, dynamic programming, all of the fun stuff. Going through the interviews I made sure to constantly tell the interviewer what I my thoughts were and why. I gave a reason for everything and when suitable reasons against anything else.

I was also asked to do a simple coding problem too. That evening I received an email saying I passed the first round and they'd like me to come back 2 days later for 3 more interviews. The interview questions were quite challenging. I don't think I did very well at the second interview, which was writing a code that takes a float and output a string representing a price in the format $xx,xxx.xx. I managed to produce a working piece of code but with a lot of help from the interviewer so I think if you're stuck, you should ask for hints and they don't mind it. I was more successful at the third interview in which I was asked solve two problems, again the programming language was my choice. The last round was different from the previous three. I was given a problem and was asked to describe an algorithm to solve it. No coding required. In fact when I started to write down some code I was reminded that I only need to describe the algorithm. Optimization was a big deal because I was asked to analyze running time of my code and to optimize them, especially at the last round. After the last round, I was asked if I need to know their decision by any specific time. I said I'd like to know their decision before then end of the year. The interviewer smiled and said it wouldn't take that long. Typically it'd take 2-3 weeks. That's why I was so surprised and excited when I got an email from them later that day announcing I was offered the position. So basically it took less than 4 days for the entire process.

I was contacted by an Amazon recruiter who scheduled an initial phone interview. The first phone interview consisted of answering basic questions on object oriented concepts and coding a fairly simple function using an online collaboration tool. After the first call the recruiter asked me to schedule a second phone interview which was very similar. I was then invited to an on-site interview the following week (their campus is located close to where I live). I went through 6 hour long meetings altogether (including one with the recruiter, two with hiring managers, and three whiteboard coding sessions with individual contributors). The building I was in was very new and modern - everyone I talked to was extremely nice and professional. Before participating in any interviews, I certainly recommend reading "Cracking the Coding Interview" - it was very helpful for me to know the types of questions that I might be asked ahead of time.

Submitted resume via university jobs board in July. In mid August, got an email from a recruiter inviting me to a group interview 10 days later. Amazon provided all travel and expenses, including 2 nights in a hotel, $85/day in transportation and $65/day in food. Interview began at 8:15 am, with 24 candidates. Vast majority of candidates presented non-American passports as identification, and only 2 were female. Breakfast was provided, two current SDEs talked to the group and took questions, then we were divided into groups of 3 and presented with a supply chain problem to solve on laptops with clean Ubuntu installs. No guidance or preference for programming languages or problem solving techniques were expressed; instead, they expect your group to come to a consensus, install the necessary tools, and rock it out. It was stressed repeatedly the exercise was NOT competitive, but instead team oriented. A group was put in each corner of the room, and a table of SDEs and HR reps sat in the middle of the room and "observed" 6 hours of work. After several hours, each candidate got a 15-20 minute 1-on-1 with an SDE to discuss the code they'd written (and not much else). The entire process is geared to maximize success for 21-25 year old males and eliminate anyone female and/or older, and inherently makes forming a quick team difficult. It's also obvious Amazon expects that new employees are looking for stepping stones rather than a long-term career as they make no effort to get to know any of the candidates, or identify specific teams on which they may fit. Got a call 2 days after getting home letting me know they wouldn't be making an offer, which was wonderful news as I was completely clear that based on the interview process, Amazon would not be a good fit for me and would have declined an offer anyway.

Was contacted for a position out of the blue by a recruiter. Had an initial phone screen, then two technical phone interviews. After the second phone interview I was invited to come to their campus for a day of interviews. I live in Seattle so I didn't fly there or anything. Had a series of interviews on campus. Each sort of focused on a different thing -- design, coding, personality. Amazon provided lunch. I thought most of the interviews went well except one, where I really choked on a problem and didn't consider a large subset of possible cases. I was told I'd find out on a Friday whether or not I got the position. Friday came and went, and I sort of spent the weekend in terror. I got an email Monday afternoon stating they were going another direction. I wasn't confident about my performance there so this wasn't much of a surprise. Everyone was really nice (except one dude, who seemed like he had a chip on his shoulder). I know they invested a lot in having me come talk to them, and I felt it was really good practice for future interviews.

I was contacted by an Amazon recruiter who noticed my resume on monster. I had one phone interview of about 90mins and was then asked to come to Seattle. I was apparently interviewing for 2 position so I met 2 hiring managers and about 2 technical people from each of their teams, 6 interviews in all. The technical interviews were nothing special, the standard questions listed here and a couple of curve balls which were really interesting and I cannot disclose them since they were sort of closely related to what they do and thus it would go against my non-disclosure agreement. They treat you really well and make you feel comfortable except when they keep challenging your answer to see if you break :)

The most difficult and unexpected question was a bunch of "What if" and "An example of when..." kind of behavioral questions. I should have prepared these, I had not and really was stumped and ended up giving them real examples and expressed my honest opinions (not a good idea esp if you are opinionated like me).   Answer Question

The interview was over the phone and used a collaborative document to allow me and the interviewer to see what each other was typing. This document was also used to share code. The interview was almost entirely technical, feeding me one problem after another. First, they asked me about Fibonacci number sequences to see if I knew anything about them and whether I could construct a method to calculate any number in the sequence by inputting what number it was in the sequence (e.g. 1 for the 3rd number, 3 for the 5th number). This was solved using a recursive solution due to the Fibonacci sequence being a recursive sequence, but the interviewer also suggested that there were non-recursive methods. He asked me to generate test cases for the method I just created. Next, the interviewer wanted me to create a structure that represents a binary search tree and write a boolean function that verified to see whether a parameter was a binary search tree.

Once my resume was @ amazon I was asked to choose 4 dates for phone interview. The interview was scheduled 7 days later. And I was instructed to go over basic computer science material. I read all glassdoor interview questions and got the hang of it. The interview was by phone with a “none native English speaker” from Seattle, it was very hard to understand what he was saying during the interview. I had to login to an online code editor to write my code answers. The interviewer asked me 1 question: how to validate a binary tree. I validated the tree using the min/max solution, but then the interviewer wanted a clean answer with no min/max. So I did it again, but then interviewer wanted a none balanced tree validation. So I did it again, but I was so frustrated that it took me a while to accomplish this simple task. All n all the interview took no more than 30 minutes. Not including the 5 minutes in the beginning to see if the online code editor was alive and to ask me about my past (with no real interest to hear the answer, it sounded like the interviewer was obligated to do so). After 4 hours I got an email stating they have decided to go with other candidates. The only thing that’s bothered me is that I was asked only 1 question. I have more than 12 years’ experience and still was asked only 1 question. I replied to HR with this issue and never got an answer. I even asked the interviewer at the end of the interview whether he has any other questions for me, but he replied “no, just the tree”. Well, great for you amazon. This is way not the way to conduct an interview. I really don’t care about the job since I am employed but still this is very frustrating interview. But then again, this is the same guy I’ll have to work with if I did got the job :)

The first round of the interview for the position of SDE for Amazon Services team was a phone interview. The interviewer asked me to join him on Collabaedit, which is an online collaboration tool. First he asked questions about my projects in school and I answered everything. Then he asked to code a problem. He gave me a binary tree and asked me to convert the binary tree into a doubly circular linked list(DCLL). The elements in the DCLL were in an inorder traversal of the tree. I told the logic of how to solve the problem and I coded the problem partially. I made some mistake in coding the problem to perfection. I asked him to ask another question but he said that he is out of time. I was expecting another call from Amazon after this phone interview since it didn't go that bad but they sent me a rejection mail after a week.

The interview process was incredibly quick; the first email to an on-site interview occurred within a matter of weeks. Being an international prospect, I went through 2 rounds of technical phone interviews before being offered an on-site interview. Each phone interview consisted of a couple technical questions, with coding done on a virtual whiteboard. The questions heavily emphasized data structures and class design. The there were 4 on-site interviews packed into a single 5 hour day; 1 HR interview and 3 technical interviews. Again, most of the technical interviews revolved around a wide and deep knowledge of data structures, with some algorithmic questions thrown in. Big-O run times were also quite important. Overall, I found the people to be friendly and the work environment to be very laid back. Most of the walls were glass or whiteboard allowing for easy collaboration between team members.

C++ supports multiple inheritance of classes, Java (and C#) supports single inheritence of classes and multiple inheritance of interfaces. When C++ added multiple-class inheritence pure OOP was thought to be "the" solution to everything. In the meantime it was proven that class inheritance is good, but it ends up with tightly coupled systems. The more class inheritance you use, the more likely that one small change will have a huge impact on your entire system. Loosely coupled inheritance - interfaces - are considered a much better option these days.

My friends hand in my resume and I get the on-site interview directly. The interview process is basical, first have a lunch with several amazon employee. Then each candidate was brought to the room and start the interview. I had four interviews in total, and I did perfectly in the first one, the second one and the last one. I think they fail me because I didnt do well in the third one. So, just bear in mind that Amazon is very picky, if you screw up one of the four interviews, then you fail.

They were building a new site in Cambridge so they had the interview in Boston at a hotel. I waited in the lobby for the interviewers, who arrived in an elevator and then took you to be interviewed. Others also waited in the lobby to be interviewed. I was told there would be either 2 or 4 1:1 interviews, each about an hour. The interview itself was primarily what my experience was, followed by questions about things I had done, followed by coding problems. Then I was asked if I had any questions for them. I was already happily employed and would not have looked forward to driving to Cambridge. That day it took me 1.5 hours to arrive. Also I had read about carrying a pager here on glassdoor.com, and asked the interviewers about that. One said you carry it for a week every month; the next said you carry it for a week every 2 months. I was told at the end of my 2nd interview that there would be just 2 interviews that day. I responded, "That must be a bad sign" with the response that it probably wasn't a good sign. Sure enough I did not get the job.

I was contacted by Amazon from linkedin. They want to know if I am interested to go to sydney for their hiring event. I said I can't go to sydney because I live in Brisbane and told them that my strength is in .Net and Amazon does not hire .Net programmer but she told me that it is ok. So I accepted to have the normal method of interview. We had a few emails back and forth and the lady from Amazon was quick to respond my emails (usually a few hours). First step was a coding exercise. Usually initial coding exercises are easy and are designed to see if the interviewee can write code at all. So she sent me the question and I had three hours to finish it. The question was: given an array of ints, find the sum of most common repeated number. For example {4,2,3,1,8,3} should return 3+3 = 6. I had to give two answers one with least time complexity and one with least space complexity. So I implemented the typical answers using a hashmap, or the naive one with O(1) space complexity and one extra using sort. I unit tested and documented all my code properly, also had time to write a performance test and document how to parallelize any of the algorithms. Its been a while since I sent them the answer but I received no response. The lady who was quick to reply to my emails also did not reply to my follow up email! It is really disrespectful, asking someone to sit for a test and totally ignoring him after that! Even if my code have been terrible and the guy has had a heart attack after seeing it they could tell me that sorry, we don't want to go further! It wasn't me chasing them after all. After about a week and two follow ups, I have been said that they were trying to contact me trough another email. However I scheduled a phone interview and fingers crossed on that.

The interview process consisted of two phone interviews. Each phone interview lasted about 45 minutes and include about 20 minutes spent coding in a chat room. The first interview began by asking me to describe my background for a few minutes. Then there were questions about basic object oriented programming concepts. Then they ask about concepts specific to whatever language you're most comfortable with. Then they asked about concepts dealing with a secondary programming language. Then they ask about data structures. Then they asked me to design an algorithm dealing with a particular data structure and to analyze the time complexity of the algorithm. Then I had to code the algorithm. The second interview was very similar to the first, except it was quite a bit more difficult because the interviewer wasn't as helpful in guiding me using the coding portion of the interview.

I had the interview with Amazon yesterday so still waiting to hear back about a second interview. The interviewer was very friendly and accommodating (I had bad phone signal) and we started off easy with him asking me all about previous positions on my resume. He wanted to know what projects I was proud of and which ones were most difficult. We then moved into talking about common scenarios you might encounter as a developer such as finding areas of code which are slow and how to fix them. He wanted to know details of the debugging process starting from when a manager comes to you and says "This page is too slow" for example. After that he wanted me to design a class structure for a furniture factory. There was already a simple (but flawed) structure in place and I was asked to improve it based upon various upgrades they wanted to implement. If you know your OO you'll be fine, it was mostly common sense stuff. It ended up with the data structure/algorithm question which I was asked to describe in detail then code using an online collaboration tool so he could see me typing. The problem was writing an algorithm to detect when two linked lists intersect. The key I think is to keep talking and make sure you are explaining what you're thinking. He wanted me to improve the initial design and so I did and he accepted it as a good solution. We then talked a bit about Amazon, Seattle and what I'd be working on if I got the job. Overall I think it went well and as long as you're up on details on your resume, OO and data structures you should be ok.

I was offered to interview on campus without a phone screen, flight and hotel paid for. The process consisted of several 45-min 1:1 technical interviews, and the questions were not incredibly difficult (mainly dealing with data structures and algorithms). However, it felt like some of the interviewers were expecting very specific answers and couldn't understand my thought process (when it didn't match theirs exactly). Half of the interviewers seemed tired and not that happy to be there, one walked into the room with an attitude and stayed that way throughout the whole time. Overall, it wasn't a very good experience and did not show off the company in a good light, (as far as software engineering department goes at least).

I was initially contacted by a recruiter who found my resume from my college's career management center. The process was very quick, I was flown to Seattle with all expenses covered. All of the interview logistics were very streamlined and I was impressed with everything in that regard. As for the interview process itself, it was quite stressful. The process consisted of 4 back to back technical interviews. Every question I was asked involved coding the solution on a whiteboard. The questions focused exclusively on data structures and algorithms. I wasn't asked any trivia type questions like "What is OOP?" or "Explain garbage collection in Java". My advice would be to make sure you are keen on algorithm questions, and to prepare at least a month in advance.

The interview had all of the normal formalities. Some friendly chat, a lunch, talk about the area and the policies at Amazon. Interview questions were almost exclusively about working with high performance data structures - hashes, maps, tables, trees and the like. All questions inevitably led to "how would you do it faster", which really meant "how would you make it more scalable". Being able to solve the problem in O(n) time or better is key. In short, be adept with the standard data structures and using them optimally. It involved writing almost all of the functions on a whiteboard. Heuristics were brushed upon briefly, only to lead to "okay, now that you've done that - how would you do it faster?". There weren't any questions about working with others, design processes, maintainability, past experience. They showed no interest in any portfolio content. They were happy to answer questions about what it's like to work there, but I detected some dishonesty about it - it was not as good as they made it sound. Individuals and teams are "on call" 24/7 for any bugs that are found in their code. Other sites cite Amazon for poor home/work balance. Managers didn't seem to understand their leadership role. While the newer projects and cutting edge algorithms/designs obviously excited the engineers, it seemed like there was a lot of tension. Conversely, the workplace was riddled with fun posters, decor, sticky notes, nerf guns and dogs. I feel I did relatively well in the interview - I was able to clarify their deliberately vague requests and produce a quick sample/algorithm, and then refine it to what I believed to be optimal (which came out to O(1) or O(n) in my cases). I was honest that I had not sought to work for them (they found me), that I needed to consider Seattle a bit more before moving, and that I had little experience in working on large server/database applications. I probably gave off a lot of enthusiasm for areas of software that are of little interest to Amazon. They contacted me back and said they were not interested in continuing. Neither was I.

A friend put in my resume and I was contacted by phone about a week later by an HR rep. She was very short and was interested in only setting up the interview. She was reluctant to discuss the position or company. On the day of the interview the interviewer called me a few minutes late. He was friendly but seemed hurried. He asked me some questions about my most difficult project and the program I was most proud of. He asked some technical questions related to projects I was working on. He seemed uninterested in my work history. After about 10 minutes of talking he sent me a link to a window and gave me a programming assignment. I asked some follow up questions and began to write out an algorithm on a notepad nearby, talking through my thought process all the while. After 2 or 3 minutes he insisted I stop writing and begin coding. I feel like planning first is better but he was running the show. Know your data structures by heart and be able to code them in your sleep. Terminology is important too.

I was contacted by a recruiter and since I was working already I managed to convince the recruiter to let me bypass the phone screen and go straight to on-site interviews. There were a total of 4 interviews that day from a specific team. The order of interviewers was random but for me it was : my future manager, Director of the team, a senior developer and a PM of another sub-team within that team. I dressed really casually (jeans & Tees) sitting next to a bunch of undergrad in suits. Guys please don't wear suits to tech interviews, not a brogrammer move. The process was pretty tiring and my first 2 interviews were pretty good, 3rd one was ok and by the 4th one my brain pretty much decided to stop function at certain points. Also, the questions were mostly technical and actually somehow related to the kind of problem the team was solving so it gave me a pretty good idea of stuff I'll potentially work on. The interviewers were definitely smart and nice. About half of the questions involves coding. My strongest lang was Java but I coded in JavaScript cause it's fast to cook up something, other than using verbose Java and stuff. They seem to appreciate the reasoning so make sure you know what ur doing/talking about. The offer comes the next day (around 27 hours later to be exact). They move fast cause Amazon is hiring a lot.

I was selected to bypass a phone screening and attend an on-site interview with a large group of other interviewees (though the interviews itself were on an individual basis). The interview day consisted of 4, 45 minute technical interviews each conducted by a different interviewer. Coding on the whiteboard is required (or sometimes on paper), and each of the interviews you are given a complex coding question that you must solve in front of them. These questions may be relatively simple if you remember all of your algorithm knowledge from college very well, otherwise you must go in with a significant knowledge of trees (binary and binary search, etc), data structures in general, searching and sorting algorithms, object oriented programming, just to name a few.

When I answered, he asked for the time complexity of my solution and asked me to come up with a faster solution, and then when I came up with a faster solution, he asked for an even faster one again.

Attended two phone interviews. Lots of questions on operating systems, data structures and programming.

The second interview gave a homework coding problem and asked use send the complete source code and header file by email. The homework coding problem was basically to write a program to search an array of sorted numbers linearly (not binary search) based on certain conditions such as return a number that is greater than or equals some X and so on. Did the interview pretty well, in my opinion, but they never bothered to call back and HR was very unresponsive for follow ups.

Applied for the recent grad Software Developer position. I got an email about a month later stating I was selected for a phone interview. I was called at the exact time stated in the email. The interviewer had a strong accent and was hard to understand over the phone. First, basic questions were asked such as why you wanted to work at Amazon, etc. Eventually went to technical questions, which since Java was my strong suit listed, was about Java. A bunch of things about OOP and Java specifics: inheritance, interfaces and abstract classes, difference between final, finally and finalizer, etc. Then I was given a coding problem. This part was kind of awkward. I was told to put the phone down for a few minutes and code, then read the code back to him over the phone. So imagine reading code over the phone: int, functionName, left parentheses, int x, right parentheses, open curly brace.... Anyway, I was emailed 3 days later stating I was not selected. Overall, the phone interview was not difficult. Just brush up on what you learned before.

Was asked which one is better, I told me it depends on the system that you want to model, not one better than the other. Also was asked to provide real life example from previous project, instead of fake examples. Not sure how he takes my answer. Third question was to come up with algorithm to find intersection of two linked list. Interviewer was patient to guide through the thinking process, but still a pain. Came up one basic solution, then he asked for alternative solution to improve the performance. Gave him something like searching for sub-string. Don't know how he like it or not. Had brief conversation with him about their interview process is better for fresh graduate student rather than experienced engineer. He said Amazone is hiring for the whole company rather than specific group.

Got a call for first phone interview. Went ok, could answer most of the questions except for one. Give some good solutions. One of the question I was knew already so it wasn't very difficult for me to think. Was skeptical to get a call for second phone interview but I did get a call. The second interview went really very well... a perfect example of excellent interview... answered all the questions with 100% accuracy without a single doubt in mind. The interviewer was happy could make it from the conversation and it ended in 30mins since he said he did not have anymore questions to ask. Well was waiting for an onsite call but got a reject finally. Well my luck didn't turn out well.. Little bit of disappointment.... it happens all the time.

I was contacted by a recruiter based on my LinkedIn profile who set me up for a phone interview. There were 2 rounds of phone interviews after which I was invited to their Seattle office for an onsite. Recruiters and HR staff were very prompt about letting me know the results of my interviews. After the initial interview, I was notified within 24 hours of their interest in moving forward. The onsite consisted of five 1:1 interviews including lunch with the manager. The manager asked me an interview question while eating lunch which was not the most pleasant experience. It was obvious he was ambitious and driven but did not have the best social skills. Some interviewers were friendly and encouraging while others were not.

Good luck to all those applying for job. ps: Data structures and Algorithms are two very important topics as far as the interview is concerned. Also, go over 'Hash Maps'.

Got an initial interview from the company due to a friend's referral. The initial interview consisted of a phone screening. I also got an on-campus interview afterward, which was unrelated to the phone interview. The on-campus interview consisted of a first-round interview on a Monday. They then called on Monday night to inform me that I had made the second round, which would take place in the form of three interviews on campus over the next two days. All the interviews were very technical, with one or two behavioral/resume questions thrown in. The interviewers themselves were pretty laid-back and fairly helpful, they weren't trying to confuse me or make life difficult. They told me that they would get back to me by the end of the week, but took until the middle of the next week to get back to me. I wasn't offered the position, even though I thought I did reasonably well on the interviews.

The second interview consisted of two questions, the first question was to find whether any two numbers in an array sum up to give a third and the second question was to print a matrix in spiral order. After the two interviews I received an email from the recruiter to schedule a third. The third interview consisted of more theoretical questions such as define OOP and was also a little behavioral (interviewer asked me about my projects, about working in teams etc.) The coding question was to find a pythagoran triplet in an array which I solved in O(n^2) time using a hash table. I thought my last interview went pretty well but I did not receive an offer.

Applied online through the local campus career center. Initially was supposed to have an on-campus interview although due to extenuating circumstances, some of these interviews were canceled. Spoke with recruiting and was later scheduled for two phone interviews scheduled. The hiring process consisted of two back-to-back interviews each 45 minutes in length. The first interviewer was straight down to business and asked me some programming questions while the second one took some time to answer any questions I had about the company before asking me some programming as well as design and behavioral questions. Both interviewers were courteous and gave me the time I needed to solve the presented problems. One piece of advice I would offer is to verbalize your thoughts when attempting to solve a problem so that the interviewers can get a feel for your thought process and nudge you in the right direction if you are a little stumped on a particular question.

The process took so long not due to Amazon but because of my own scheduling constraints. I was first contacted early July, and had the first phone interview late July. The second phone interview was also late July. Then the on-site interview was at the beginning of September. About a week after the on-site interview they contacted me with their offer. First the interview was for a position in the transaction risk management group (what the recruiter found me for), but then also for a position in the global fulfillment platform group. The second position was referred to me by a friend at Amazon because he knew the manager of the group. My first phone interview was with the first team, my second phone interview was with the second team, and for my on-site I talked with the first team in the morning and the second team in the afternoon. The on-site interview was spread out between two of Amazon's Seattle offices. Once everyone moves to the new South Lake Union office this thankfully shouldn't happen any more -- it's pretty annoying, especially when the interviewers don't really know the shuttle schedule that well and you miss the right shuttle! On-site interviews consisted of one engineer from each team, the manager for each team, some engineers from other teams, and one architect that was working with multiple teams. I think the architect was probably the "bar-raiser" but really his questions were not any more difficult than the others. He did not seem as easy to get along with though which made it more stressful.

I sent in my resume online, then I talked with a friend of mine who worked there. He helped as he was able to do something in the resume database to make sure I was called. I was also called separately by a recruiter who found my information on linked-in. This put me in the loop for a couple open positions. It seems the goal of Amazon is to process as many candidates as possible but it's not a perfect system. I was originally targeted for a group that I was not as interested in and wasn't as good a fit for. I told them that I was interested in another team and they were good about putting me on both loops. I think this didn't matter initially, as the interviews are not specific at first.

Got contacted by recuiter from Amazon through phone. Since I don't take calls from numbers I don't recognize, he left me a voice message and also sent me an email. He said he found my resume on Dice.com. I replied him back with some questions, and available times. He scheduled a phone interview next day for following Monday. Interviewer called me 10 minutes late. His native language was not English and he was on a speakerphone, so I had a hard time understanding him. But I was able to understand him once he started talking on the phone not through the speakphone. There was not overview of what he's doing just straight to the first question. Asking me about my experiences in software engineering. Asked me if I am proficient with Java, then asked me if I am familiar with C++. Then asked me about Java keywords final, finalize, and finally. I couldn't remember what finalize was, and he briefly explained me then I could remember it was for garbage collection. I told him its relationship with the garbage collection, then he asked me to explain how Java does garbage collection. After my explanation (mentioning Mark&Sweep among them), he ask me if I know how Mark&Sweep is implemented. I know what it was but didn't know how it's implemented (extra bit, traversing from each "roots"), I just told him I do not know. Two coding questions followed. Given array of integers, how do you find the first pair that adds up to 10. I asked if the array contains negative numbers, and he said yes. Solved the problem using HashMap, then he asked me the second coding question. Given array of integers represending historic stock prices sorted in order of date (first one is the earliest price and the last is the latest price.) If you can trade only one stock, you can only buy once and sell once, and can hold the stock maximum 30 days, how would you find the buying and selling point that maximize the profit. I tried to clearify some points buy asking if each number represent closing price. I couldn't solve it, and he dumbed it down to following question. You have an array of 30 integers representing the historic stock price sorted by date. How would you find the buying and selling point that maximize the profit? I paniced that I screwed up the interview, and couldn't think of anything better than O(n^2) brute force solution. He asked me to send him the answer through email. I asked what kind of software development environment they use (RAD, eclipse, emacs, etc.), and if he enjoys working for the company. He was pretty honest about what he likes and doesn't like about the company. After the interview was over, I tried to solve the problem with better algorithm which I couldn't find. I ended up sending something stupid, tried to go to bed (which I couldn't) and sent the brute force one too. Next day, I was able to solve the problem, and sent him the solution. It's been 4 days and I'm still waiting to hear back from them.

I was contacted by an Amazon.com recruiter without me applying for any position. I assume they found me at Dice.com. I set up a phone interview with the recruiter and scheduled it for later in the week. The interviewer opened with information about what they were looking for, a generalist programmer basically, then asked if I had any questions for him, I did but he couldn't answer them very well since he is not on the team that the job is for. Then he went into questions, first he asked me about garbage collection, I think he was looking for how it works at a low level, but wanted a very general answer. Next he asked about how browsers and the internet work, again very general answer. The programming problem dealt with looking for substrings without using high level language methods, I'll post that question. Then he gave me another chance for questions. About half a week later I was contacted for a second phone interview (they said there could be up to 3 phone interviews) which is scheduled for later this week.

The phone interview was slated to be an hour long, started on time and was 1 hour exactly. It was the 2nd such interview, and I have a 3rd scheduled. No idea how many more rounds there will be. It began with a brief questioning of my past work experience, and soon moved on to technical questions largely covering data structures and algorithms, from simple (calculate change for a cash register) to complex (knapsack problem, dynamic programming). I was also given a design problem of an e-commerce site and asked to describe some of the basic objects I would need for customers, inventory, orders and shipping, and their interactions. I was expected to provide a pseudo-code solution to the data structures and algorithms questions, which made pen and paper a necessity. It might be more helpful to sit at a computer and actually code up the solution in something like PHP or Python. The interviews have (thus far) been very nice and tolerant of you not reaching a complete solution to the problems on your first iteration. They may even help walk you through a tough part.

They started with a phone interview. It lasted for an hour. Questions were asked about my research work. Then I was asked few questions on socket/POSIX threads programming. 1. What does select do? 2. How would you make a socket non-blocking? 3. What are the issues in using multi-threaded systems? 4. Describe in simple words how would you set up a TCP connection using sockets? Then there were questions on algorithms: 1. What is a BST? Provide an algorithm to merge two BSTs. 2. Find two numbers in an array that will add up to a particular value? (O(nlgn) or better) 3. How would you access (k-3) element of a linked list? Feedback was in a week. My second phone interview described a custom situation in network protocol development. I was asked to design classes and illustrate how my design will handle their requirements. Ability to understand requirements, finding the right classes and handling minute details of situations were analyzed. Interview lasted around 45 min - 1 hr. Very much an architectural question which combined software design abilities beautifully. Feedback was within couple of days. I was called for a face to face. Mostly architectural questions, software design questions, C++, behavioral questions. I would say the whole interview process required lot of concentration from me.

I had 2 phone screens followed by a on-site interview in Seattle. The phone screens were pretty standard - binary trees problem, 1 object oriented design problem, coding problem. The onsite interview was slightly tougher than phone screen but not very much. I had 2 split interviews where 1 interview would ask questions while the other make notes. This was my bar raiser interview. Though the question was tough, they were looking at how I approached the question, clarifications asked and use of standard algorithms to fit to the problem. Most of their questions were tough but nothing crazy- simple problems but require proper coding, tricky algo problems (pseudo code), few design problems. It is tiring by the end of the day. My mind was almost shut off during the last interview, but the interviewer was kind enough to acknowledge it and give additional time. Most the interviewers were extremely cordial and explained their questions clearly. They were ready to accept different approaches to answers. I really enjoyed the whole process.

Was initially contacted through e-mail by an Amazon recruiter who set up the initial phone interview. The first interview was with a project leader who worked on the front end/web design team. Most of the questions were about basic CS concepts (arrays, data types, hash tables). The main question involved designing a variation of the DOM with some specific requirements. Second phone screening was a bit more difficult. Was asked to describe some of the differences between Java and C++. Main question was how to efficiently find the most common 3-page path on a website given an arbitrarily large log file. Described the basic algorithm over the phone and was asked to code it up and submit it by the end of the day. Overall, the process was fun and challenging. Interviewers were friendly, but eager to "get down to business". I have received an offer for an in person interview, but have not yet finished the process as of this writing.

I had a phone interview with Amazon. I was referred by a friend from mitbbs, and was contacted by a recruiter about one week after the referral. We set up a time for the first phone interview. The recruiter was responsive and nice, and the only weird thing was that she mentioned she would send me some application forms but she never did. I didn't quite have a real expectation to get an offer from Amazon. For the first phone interview, I was surprised that the interviewer called 3hours earlier than I expected, but it turned out to be my mistake :( I didn't pat attention to the time zone. Even though I was caught by a surprise, the first phone interview was just a piece of a cake for me, the coding problem was simply deleting some numbers in an array. After that there was an even simpler classic problem: in an array, all numbers appear twice except one special number, how to find that number. I told the interviewer with honesty that I knew the problem and he moved on to the next. The next and also last problem was asking, if you have two eggs, N floors, how to find the critical floor number below which all eggs dropped will not break, and above which all eggs dropped will break. By the way, their interviewers are really really nice. I was informed about passing the first interview only two days later. I had the second interview about two weeks later during travel. I was not fully prepared but I was much less nervous than the first time, as I was getting very close to my dream offer from another company. The interviewer called, and started with asking me why I want to be a software engineer. Then he asked me about some knowledge and concepts of hashing, which I was quite familiar with. After that was the coding question, which was sent to me as an email. After reading the problem and explaining my approach to the interviewer, he decided not to have me write the code! I still couldn't figure out why, since clearly the title of the email said "coding question". Maybe I left him an impression that my coding skills were so strong that he didn't even need to see it? But I never demonstrated any of my coding skills to him. The last problem was OOD, as expected from Amazon's interview. I was relatively weak in this area, but I managed to grab some key words and key ideas which made him somewhat content. I was notified about the result a couple of days later, and I was told by the recruiter that I did very well in my phone interviews, although I personally doubt it...

My resume was submitted via a friend to an internal recruiter with Amazon.com. The resume was then picked up by a department seeking an SDE. The department's recruiter contacted me via email to set up a phone interview, which was scheduled in short order. At the appointed time, I received a call from the interviewer who turned out to be a SDE in the department (as opposed to the hiring manager). She provided me an overview of the responsibilities of her team and then asked me to say a little about myself, which I did. Then the interview got technical. She asked me a data structures/selection algorithm question followed by an object question. After I was done with those, I had an opportunity to ask questions, which I did. The entire interview took an hour. While I get that amazon.com deals with large quantities of data and efficient evaluation of that data is necessary, I think they may be eliminating very good candidates with excellent capacity to learn (like myself, of course) by asking for answers to questions that the CODE IS ALREADY WRITTEN FOR. This is a commentary, of course on the data structure/algorithm question. Object design is a more obvious way to see how I think and approach problem solving.

First emailed on September 15, 2009. Rejected by email on October, 15 2009. I had three phone interviews with the Customer Returns area and the Ops area. The first interview was with a younger, male developer. It had a "get to know you" section and two technical questions: Find the first common element in two sets (implement the code), and design the objects needed to run a jukebox. The second interview was with a senior male developer. It also had a "get to know you" section and two technical questions: Given a time-ordered log of user visits to web pages find the most common 3-page sequence (implement the code), and design a poker application. The third interview was with a foreign, younger female developer. She jumped right into the technical questions which were: Find the deepest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree structure (implement the code), and layout the fundamental objects to build a restaurant reservation system. This was probably the worst interview of the lot because it felt like the interviewer didn't understand the language (C++) she had asked me to write in even though I could easily have done it in several others. The biggest takeaways here were that the questions were all canned and could be looked up, the coding would have better been managed by text instead of over the phone, and there was very little feedback on how my answers were. In general, there were gaps of more than a week in which I heard nothing at all and given no insight as to why, the interviewers seemed to take notes but only the last one seemed to have read them. Overall, the whole thing was just a long, drawn-out mess, and a waste of a month. I'm lucky enough to be currently employed or I would be irate about how slow the process was. When I interviewed with several other companies (including Microsoft) a couple years ago the longest it took was a week including on-site interviews. It just seemed like Amazon had a complete disregard for my time.

Submitted resume via an old boss who currently works at Amazon. After about 3 weeks, got a call from the recruiter for an initial phone screen the next week. Phone screen took an hour and involved highly technical questions with no real non-technical questions other than "Why do you want to work at Amazon?" Two days later, the recruiter called back and asked to schedule another phone screen. This happened the following week. Format was very similar to the first one - All technical questions and a few questions about my experience. Two days after the 2nd phone screen, received an email stating they'd like to fly me up for an on-site interview. Fly up to Seattle day before the interview, and got to look around the town. The actual on site interview process consisted of 5 developer interviews that were about 45 minutes each. These interviews were heavily white-board based and involved high level design questions, low level coding questions, and debugging / support process questions. Interviewers all seemed very relaxed and informal. They did not seem so much about trying to find gaps in your knowledge / wrong answers as they were about pushing you towards the limits of what you knew and then seeing how you dealt with questions that you did not immediately know the answer to. One of the 5 developer interviews was the bar-raiser, who's purpose at Amazon is ensuring that you're smart and a good fit for Amazon as a company. Many of the questions in this interview were more high level asking about design patterns, and language specifications. While the interview definitely was more difficult than the others, it did not feel overly aggressive or negative. In addition to the developer interviews, there was lunch with the hiring manager and a 15 minute interview with the recruiter. The lunch was an opportunity to ask more about Amazon and the team. Recruiter interview was to discuss benefits, salary, and total compensation. After the on site interview, I received a call within 2 days from the recruiter with the initial offer.

I initially contacted Amazon through the career fair at my university; I gave them my resume at that time. Shortly after that, they contacted me to schedule an initial technical interview with a software development manager. The first interview was difficult, but I apparently answered the questions well enough to be invited back for three more technical interviews with Amazon software engineers. I went through a total of four in-person 1-on-1 technical interviews, each lasting approximately 45 minutes. After I completed those interviews, a recruiter notified me within a few days to notify me that Amazon would be offering me a job, and a different recruiter contacted me a couple of days after that to give me the specifics of the offer. My advice: the interview questions will be difficult, but be confident, explain your thought process well, and retain your composure even if you think the interview is going badly. You might be doing better than the interviewer is letting on.

I had a phone screen with one of the senior engineers on the team. He asked me a series of software engineering questions involving Object Oriented design. It wasn't too hard of an interview as they started off with feeler questions such as "What is polymorphism? What is a hash table" It then moved on to algorithms where they wanted me to come up with the algorithm to shuffle a deck of cards. Afterwards, they wanted me to analyze the Big O(n) run time of my algorithm. I was then invited to an on campus interview that consisted of talking to 4 different software engineers. Every single engineer was constantly making me code on the whiteboard. I would definitely practice coding on the whiteboard before coming to the interview. They didn't care which language I used. They also have a bar raiser who is supposed to make you sweat. All in all, the interview process was fair.

Was called for interview through college co-op placement system. Had 3 x 30min interviews back-to-back. All three interviews had a few soft skills questions ("tell me about yourself", "describe a time you had to complete a project under pressure for a deadline".. etc.). The first interview was mainly focused on OO. Was asked some basic OO questions and asked to do a white board question designing a system using UML diagrams. The second interview didn't have any whiteboard questions. It mostly consisted of technical questions (e.g. "how much linux do you know", networking questions, searching and sorting methods). The third interview was mostly focused on one main whiteboard question. It was a simple array question. When finished the solution I was asked to improve the time complexity of my answer using maps. Revise : Data structures, networking, searching&sorting, OO, Linux commands, time complexities

A recruiter contacted me for the job and before long I had a phone call set up. There first round was a 30-40 min phone talk followed by a 90 coding exercise. The 30-40 min technical talk was no particularly difficult(I had been looking into the kind of questions they might ask): difference between array and linked list, difference between threads and processes, what is a interface and what is it used form, what is a static class, how would you find all occurrences of a web address in dozen files on your machine - with the followup: what if the files were somewhere in the cloud on thousands of machines. One Ice breaker question: describe the project you are working on. One behavioral question: can you describe a time where you had to solve a task given very little support. For the second part I got a codility link with 2 exercises to solve in 90 min. I found it hard to solve both problems in 90 min so that's where it all came crumbling down.

I got this interview opportunity after my friend refers my resume. I have been preparing for this interview in 2 weeks, mainly reading 'crack the code interview' and leetcode. The questions are not really difficult, but I guess I got nervous and not really get used to the phone interview process. As the interviewer is on the other side of the line, and I have to keep talking, I don't really get myself sometime to really think of the answers of the questions. Instead, I feel I am mislead by the interviewer. Maybe what I should do is to ask for 5 minutes of my time to think of the questions first, before answering...

Applied online. Two weeks later got an email from a recruiter and a link to access a Codility test. Had to do the test within 7 days or else it expires. The test consisted of 3 problems and I had a total of 90 min (basically 30min each) to complete the test. Results were marked by a machine, but the email from the recruiter said that they'll assign an engineer to have a look at the code. For preparation, I went through all the lessons on Codility. The difficulty level of the questions from the actual test was way more advance than the "painless" level. I could only solve one. Then three weeks later got a rejection email from the recruiter. Never spoken to an actual person. All communications were via emails. Got no feedback, because apparently Amazon's policy does not provide specific or individual feedback. Seems like the use of Codility is for quick filtering of candidate, but it totally misses out on the thinking process and the communication skills of the candidate.

As an overseas candidate, I had 2 phone screens and then got invited to Toronto for an on-site interview. Both phone calls took around 1 hour, and on-site was 3 hours, consisting of 4 sessions, each with different people. Despite answering all the questions correctly and in time except the bar raiser, didn't get an offer and if I didn't ask, they weren't even going to respond after the on-site.

They asked 1 programming question for each phone interview. During the on-site, a system design, 3 programming questions were asked. System design and 2 questions were fairly easy but the bar-raiser was seriously hard, considering thet only left me 20 minutes to solve it.

It started with the two round phone interviews, around 15 mins general talk and then focused on code interviews on collabedit.com. They are all around 1 hours each.

A friend referred me to the role. All communication was done by email. I picked up a time that I could take the technical test, and when the time has come, the recruiter sent the test by email. This was for the Brazilian office, so the process was shorter than for the US office (the recruiter told me). The test was 2 questions and I had 60 minutes (extensible to 90 if needed) to develop the 2 questions, either in Java or C++. After the time, I sent the email back with my answers, and after 4 days they told me that I didn't make it. All the process was really cool, the recruiter answered all the emails as fast as possible and was very nice to me.

The first question was to find the first word on a stream that do not repeat in the rest of the stream. I got some Interfaces that I needed to implement, there was a example input and output.   2 Answers The second question was to design a backup system that count how many tapes would be required to store files in the most efficient way, knowing that: 1.

I usually don't write reviews but since I used glass door a lot, I wanted to give back some. So I interviewed for an Australian position. I first went through 2 phone screens which included coding and behaviour and technical behavioural questions (eg. what is clean code?). The emphasis was on getting the coding correct and less on the behavioural stuff but be prepared for those type of questions like: when was a challenging time you had at work, how do you deal with tight deadlines etc... The second phone interview coding question is a bit harder than the first phone interview. I then got scheduled in for an on-site interview at the Australian office but predominantly it was done through VC link to Seattle HQ. Due to the time zone difference, initially my interview would start at 8am, 5 interviews then lunch break then final interview. A total of 6 interviews, 5 of them are 45mins, 1 of them only 30 mins. This interview was setup 3 weeks in advance but 36 hours before the interview, I get an email from Amazon HR that the schedule has changed and that it will be 6 interviews in a row. So do the maths, that's 4 hours and 15 mins STRAIGHT. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out 6 interviews in a row is going to mentally drain you...to death. I was set up. They knew this was going to happen as the change was due to an Australian manager being in the US. I'm sure they knew this well in advance. Even other Australians didn't get this treatment. This severely tested my mental endurance. Ok - I had a bathroom break in the middle and got some water but that was it. I was doing really well until the last 10 minutes of the 4th interview where I couldn't fix a bug in my program. I was brain dead and stressed. Overall the people I interviewed with were nice, but some came across as unbelievably arrogant. To you young ones out there, I am 30 years old and have worked for 8 years as a professional software engineer at major companies. These are very much red flags of how the company treats people, at a system level and also at a personal level. I've been around long enough to see and smell poison when it comes. Nice on the surface, but fundamentally don't care about you. Just do some research on Amazon's poor attrition rates and work culture. Money only means so much. Do some research in how many job advertisements there are for Amazon SDEs over the last 3-4 years, there's a zillion. You're going to be a cog in a machine. The Amazon formal PROCESSED hiring bar is quite high but it is selectively applied to certain positions. But not everyone gets in this way. I personally know people who got in by references at Amazon, Google and Facebook. My point here is that they're all still human, just like you and me. Don't let the high bar intimidate you. I'm writing this review not necessarily to get you in but to help you see companies for what they are. If you want in - ok great, but your choice. If it's your first tech job, then go for it. MOST IMPORTANTLY, ask yourself this question: do really want to work for eCommerce websites/<insert job here> or are you interested in Amazon because of their brand name/high salary? Do you know Amazon has both boring and interesting tech jobs? How important is this to you? How does this affect your future career path? What is your purpose in life? Is it related to your career? Consider work-life balance etc... Long story, I couldn't start in the time they wanted me (I was at least 4/5 months delayed) to so they didn't offer me at the time and said will coordinate further down the track. Did I get rejected? Probably. In the mean time, I got a very good job offer with very very interesting work form another reputable company. After Amazon's interview, the hardest I've ever done, this other company's was relatively easier. Even if you don't succeed, the interview process will train you for the future but learn from your mistakes. Trust God and have confidence in yourself. God bless

I applied on the web responding to an offer and providing a resume. I was contacted the day after (really) and asked to have an online programming test. I had 7 days to do it but I did it right after receiving the email. The test was of 2 hours and consisted in three problems, two of them were pretty easy and I found the last one much harder. The email explained that the code will be reviewed manually by Amazon engineers. Less than a week later, I was invited to set a date for a phone interview. We set it for two weeks later. The interview was 90% technical and included basic data structure knowledge and complexity. There also had a conception question and a problem solving. Nothing too complicated for a serious candidate. They mailed me back a week later (a Friday) to invite me to join an Assesment Day the next Thursday. I went to it, it consisted in a day starting with a short introduction to the different teams and the challenge they had to face. We were 8 to this assesment day, 4 such days were organized and we were told they had 6 vacancies. After the presentation, I had 4 face-to-face interviews each of 45 min - 1h, with a nice sandwich pause between the second and the third interview. Almost all interviews included question based on the experience ("Tell me a time when ..."). They dig into your example quite far, so come up with real and interesting examples. The second interview only consisted in a programming session which I found very easy compared to the other technical questions. Of course, all interviews were mainly technical. The first one was about generalities and were pretty easy. I found the third and the fourth much more difficult. The third one included a long conception question and a problem solving question. Finally, the last one was only a problem solving question (a problem that the team had actually had to handle, probably simplified) that we discussed very deeply. These are the only interviews where I was not able to provide what I thought to be the best answer, since I came up with better ideas soon after the interviewers left the room. For problem solving question, especially the last one, they don't seem to be interested in seeing you solve that all, but rather detect all the difficulties and propose a naïve solution (but being aware of that and explaining what should be improved and how, if you have any idea).

The design you proposed me seems fine to me, it will probably work. Though, let's imagine that someone comes to you saying he dislikes it and ask you to change it. What do you do ?   1 Answer

I applied through the Amazon Careers website and was invited to a first 45-minute telephone interview just over two weeks later. The invitation suggested that there could be an emphasis on soft skills but the interview was entirely technical. I spoke with a more junior engineer from the team to which I was applying. After some small talk, I was asked three relatively simple technical questions to be solved in a Collabedit environment. The interview ran for slightly more than 1 hour. I heard back the same day that I would go through to a second telephone interview, this time with a more senior engineer on the same team. The interview was set for six days later. There was less small talk in this second interview, which went straight into technical questions. I was asked to work on one problem, again in Collabedit. The interviewer said at the end of the interview that they had wanted to ask follow-up questions but there wasn't enough time, since they were sticking to the 45-minute window. I heard back two days later that I would not be invited in for the face-to-face interview. While all the interactions up to the rejection were of a quite relaxed nature, the rejection letter was quite formal.

I would rather not give away specifics but I will say that all the questions I was asked were relatively straightforward and based on searching and sorting integer arrays and tree data structures. There were some follow-up questions on time/space complexity as well.   1 Answer

The first question was reconstruct a tree according a two dimension array and the second was an ODD problem. I had 60 minutes to solve both questions. The test wasn't very complex but you have to code the most efficients solutions.

The questions weren't very difficult, but before you start is really convenient try the demo question of the web tool.   Answer Question

First contact was at a job fair. Answered some basic object oriented programming questions. A few days later I was contacted by e-mail to schedule first phone interview. First phone interview were general questions about my résumé, as well as a brief explanation of the Software Development Position I was interviewing for and some additional technical questions about data structures. Contacted again to schedule a second phone interview. The second phone interview was of a more technical nature. First question was about the implementation of a phone book and how to handle misspellings, i.e. how to also return slight variations of a query. Second question was to describe how I would implement a function that determines whether 2 elements of an integer array will sum up to a certain target value. I proposed a naïve solution first (in O(N²)), but was asked to also give a possible solution that is in O(N). Both interviewers told me that the phone interviews are scheduled in such a way that there remains time at the end for the interviewee to ask question. However, as the whole process seemed pretty clear to me, I didn't have any specific questions. This might have been the reason why Amazon chose to not take my application to the next step.

Was referred by a friend. Accepted to do a 2-hour online assessment that involved 2 coding questions followed by logical questions. Did the assessment without using outside sources because they monitored your browsing activity, did screen capturing and you had to be on webcam the whole time. After completing that assessment the following survey asked what online sources I used to aid me. Since they didn't specify that I was able to use online sources I didn't use any making it way harder than it should have been. Felt very uncomfortable in the way that they monitored me scaring me from using online sources. Overall non-human interaction I feel is a bad way to weed people out. Felt a lot of anxiety doing the test due to being monitored so strictly. Probably would of done better if they specified before hand that you are able to use online resources to help you

First took online challenge and then invited to on-site interview. It took 2 weeks. On the interview day, I had 4 interviews with 4 different teams. Most interviewers knew what they were doing. They helped through the process. However, one of them could not manage the time, left little time for question. The other was new at interviewing and getting directions from the other one, which was confusing. An interview starts with cv questions that take 10-15 mins.

I applied at a software development engineer for Amazon Web Service, in Dublin. Initial contact was by email, all nice and well, and they told me they will send me a "coding challenge" at a given date (still by email) to complete in one hour. Fair enough, I've heard of those before, it's usually a strictly algorithmic problem to solve in the language of your choice, and this one was no exception (see below) Came the big day, I sat ready in front of my computer, and... nothing. They forgot to sent it. I had to call to remind them. Okay, this is the kind of thing that happens. Anyway, I completed the challenge, with a working solution, maybe not the most optimal, I admit, but working nonetheless and in time. After that, no answer from them, not even an acknowledgement they received it. Days, then weeks have passed : obviously, they give you one hour to do the code, but allow themselves unlimited time to have a look at it. I tried to contact them again, with no avail. I'm not the kind of person who harass people on the phone/mail, so I gave up. I'm not that desperate for a job. In the end, I'm really disappointed by the lack of professionalism, especially from a big company that boasts being constantly on the edge. It's like they didn't care.

I am from Madrid, Spain and the position was for Seattle, WA. I contacted a recruiter via email. The whole process took 3 months. They sent me a link to do an online test, through interviewzen. It consisted in two parts: - Java coding. It was about binary trees and recursion. - OOP question. It was about inheritance and polymorphism. I passed the test so they scheduled a technical phone interview with an engineer few weeks later. This was the script: 1) Questions: - First question apart of “Is this a good moment?”: Why do you want to work here? => You better be ready for this. - Which projects of your career are you proud of? - Which languages are you familiar with? - Why? => I didn’t expect this question. - Are you familiar with trees? - Really? What is a tree? 2) Technical part, coding. - We used collabedit. - It was about binary trees and recursion again. - It’s not worth it to put the question itself, just be ready to be asked about data structures, recursion and efficiency in terms of Big O. 3) Interviewing the interviewer. - You should have 3-5 questions for them. It took one hour and one minute. They sent an email 3 days later saying "we have decided to move forward with the search process in order to target the candidate…”. Looking backwards I don’t think it was difficult. I wasn’t ready enough. They were very kind with me all the time and I learnt a lot during the process.

Nothing really difficult   Answer Question

I submitted my resume online, and was contacted two weeks later for an online challenge on codility. There were three questions, which were not difficult. However, it started with the most difficult questions, and I spent over thirty minutes on that and I started to panic cause I only had 90 minutes in total. I solved the first question perfectly, but with the second one, though being easier, I missed some edge cases. The third question was too simple (think of fizz-buzz), but due to my rush, I was so exhausted and I decided to submit the answer anyway (didn't realize my mistake in the second question until late). Anyway, I thought I failed and wasn't expecting to hear from them anytime soon, but it turned out I did well enough and they moved me to the phone screening round. The first round was very simple - the engineer asked only basic questions and did some small coding. I was told then that they would do another round of phone interview - the questions weren't too difficult, and I stumbled a bit but I think I did very well. Finally, they moved me forward to the onsite interview. As I'm based in Asia and the team in Edinburgh, they sent me to the Tokyo office and I did the interview with the virtual conferencing room there. The interview questions were standard - I also stumbled a bit but basically I managed fine. I was told of that they decided to extend an offer a week later

One question involve removing a node in a linked list with recursion - I was given a buggy piece of code and was asked to fix it.

This is my experience during the campus selection drive of Amazon.com. The process started with a brief presentation by the recruitment team. The process had 5 stages. The first test was online, having 20 objective questions from various topics and 2 questions to code. One required a complete code, the other required coding a method for the specified purpose. This was followed by four technical interviews. Each interviewer constantly typed on their laptop while interviewing us, probably making a note about us. We had to think of a solution for the given problem and optimize the same. This was a "white board" test, which required us to write actual code for the solution. The questions were pretty tough, but were manageable. The interviewers were very friendly and were very open about their work culture.

The most difficult questions were from data structure implementation point of view. They required a strong understanding of the problem statement to decide the correct data structure to implement. They were very stern about the required efficiency of the solution. Getting a solution wasn't enough, we are expected to give the best solution we can possibly think of!   Answer Question

I am interviewed as part of on campus recruitment process.I am a student of NIT waranagl. this review therefore is in the context of on campus placement. There was an online aptitude test followed by technical interviews. There were four technical interviews . In the first technical interview I was asked to find the pivot element in a sorted and rotated array. O(n) solution is obvious and I gave him O(log n) solution ( binary search )and I was asked to code it.After writing the code,I was asked to check my code if it covers all the edge cases or not. I have tested it and it seemed to work for all the edge cases but the interviwer pointed out a case where my code fails and then I have corrected it.He also asked me to write the code for searching an element in the sorted rotated array using binary search. the second question is given a binary search tree ,replace each node with the sum of numbers greater than the number in the node.I gave him O(n) solution and he was satisfied with it. In the second round , I was asked to design an application that sends a message to two friends if they come within two miles of each other. I gave him a solution indicating the data structures used to maintain the friend list and model of the solution . He pointed out the cons of the solution and I modified the data structure.Then there was long discussion where I gave him different solutions and He pointed out the cons of each solution and asked me to overcome it.Finally I arrived at a solution and the interviewer was satisfied with it. He also asked me a couple of puzzles and I answered them. I think the third round was the bar raiser I was asked two questions. The first question was : Given n jars each having a colour of some value.the value of the colour is from 0 to 100. when two jars (with colours say 'a' and 'b')are combined, the colour of the resulting solution is (a+b)%100.Also (a *b) amount of gas is released .Find a way to combine all the jars to form a single jar with minimum amount of gas release.(Only adjacent jars can be combined). The problem is similar to matrix chain multiplication- O(n^3)(Dynammic Programming)and after I gave him the solution I coded it. The second question was: A quadra tree is a tree where each node has atmost 4 child nodes.(similar to a binary tree which has atmost 2 child nodes). A monitor screen (black and white) is represented by a qudra tree in the following way: case 1:IF the entire screen is white then the value in the root node is white. similarly if the entire screen is black then the root stores black. case 2:If the screen is neigther completely black nor white then the screen is divided into 4 quadrents. and the node has 4 child nodes each representing one of the quadrants.( the screen is recursively divided into subscreens). Now given two screens represented by two quadra trees, return a quadra tree which represents the overlapping of the two screens.( assume when white and white overlaps results in white,black and white overlap results in black , black and black overlap results in black). I was asked to write the code for it. Round 4: Q1: Implement a stack which supports pop_min (return minimum element in the stack in O(1) ) along with push and pop operations. I gave him a couple of solutions and I was asked to code them.The he gave me a solution (maintain a linked list of minimums in the stack) and asked me to code it. Q2: Given a binary tree with fields- {pointer to left child,poiter to right child,next pointer}. Initially the next pointers are all NULL. Now fill all the next pointers in each node with pointer to the node which is immediately right to the node in the same level. The next pointer of rightmost node in a level shold be NULL. It can be done using level order traversal using a queue but the interviewer asked me to do it without using queue or any extra memmory and in O(n) time. Hint: The logic is to fill the next pointers in the (n+1) th level while trvelling in the n th level. I was asked to code it. PERSONAL INTERVIEW (HR) There was no HR interview although I was asked some questions like -Why do you want to join amazon, future plans , tell me about yourself,your habits and interests and about why I didn't do an intern ..etc SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCES The amazon interview process is very cool.The main thing here is to stay focused since the whole process is time consuming. The interviewers were very friendly and they are not bothered about the formalities.So the experience was great.

this question is a bit difficult because of the limited time I was given to code it. Given a binary tree with fields- {pointer to left child,poiter to right child,next pointer}. Initially the next pointers are all NULL. Now fill all the next pointers in each node with pointer to the node which is immediately right to the node in the same level.

It can be done using level order traversal using a queue but the interviewer asked me to do it without using queue or any extra memmory and in O(n) time.

If any of these interviews went bad, candidates were eliminated immediately. These interviews were 1 hour each, mainly focusing on data structures and coding. Third was Hiring Manager round, where in both technical and HR questions are asked. This round spanned for 1.5 hours, Varied questions were asked. Approach is checked, and time was given for difficult questions, Fourth was Culture Fit round (1 hour), Interviewer was late and apologized twice for the same. This round was to check if one is right fit for the role at amazon. This round surprisingly had a data structure question. Then, on current project, challenging situation, why should we hire, etc. Fifth was another technical round, This time with senior interviewer (SDE-2 or SDE-3), again for Problem solving, Algorithms, Data structures and Coding. There was a puzzle to solve at the end. Feed backs after interview rounds were prompt and regular. I was informed that I was selected the next day after last round. The offer letter was dispatched in another 4 days. All Interviews took place at Amazon office in WTC building, Except first round, where interviewer started off with questions straight away, all other interviewers were friendly. In general, I felt interviewers very smart and also work environment seemed good. PS: Good Lunch was provided for the candidates who had to wait for second round :-)

I applied about one month ago. Then after two weeks, I got an email from recruiter in Amazon asking me to do an online assessment in 6 days. I've done it last night. The questions are relatively simple, people who have gone through data structures can solve it without too much thinking. It was 3 questions in up to 90 minutes. The hard part is for each question, I have to write down description of approach, assumptions, which data structures used and why, analysis on complexity, and code comments. It took me more than 10 minutes to get these documents done (one can easily tell I am not native speaker btw:) ) There was another session for behavior test after finished 3 questions. Things about whether you think you are creative, or what will you do if you find a minor bug near deadline. All self-selection questions. I just finished the first-round. Long before I get a position. Since I have to select whether get offer or not. Better to select a yes for good luck :) Wondering if I can update later

Writing documentation for 3 test questions took me a big way too long time.   Answer Question

OK, I think everybody knows an average process of Amazon's interview. So I want to write something that I didn't find usually in reviews.. HOW TO PREPARE * rest well before interview. Be in a good mood. Smile! Smile all the time! * read book "Cracking coding interview". I didn't have any single question from there, but this book has 2 huge pros - it helps you to understand how your interview will look like and how to prepare to it (yes, this first, smallest part of book helped me A LOT! I never had such interviews before), and it could help you remember basic stuffs about algorithms etc (especially if you graduated more than 5 years ago). * they will send you a list of questions to prepare. Pass whole list, use Wikipedia at least, jump between links, etc. - it will also help you * prepare your own questions for them. Be personal! Ask exactly what you want to know! Maybe, you will not have another chance to ask such questions * sleep well for at least one week before * don't drink alcohol for at least 3 days before * eat well before. Approx. - in 1-1.5 hours before. Eat something that you like, and something that is good for sure ;) * be there in 15-30 minutes before scheduled time ON INTERVIEW * talk out loud! Talk out all the time! Talk out all stupid stuffs that you have in your mind! Most probably, they don't care how much you know, they should care - how much you can "invent"! So, if you don't know some famous algorithm, but you can "invent" it just on interview (of course, with mistakes) - it's much, much better!!! * be honest. Don't try to cheat. If you know exact answer to exact question - talk out loud first - "I know an answer. I just read about it yesterday". And then, if your interviewer will say you "go on" - answer on it. First of all - they will know that you're honest person, and they can trust you. Again - it doesn't matter in general - how much you know, it matters more - how much you can invent! Because in Amazon you will solve problems that probably nobody solve before.. * amazing quote from book "Cracking coding interview": "Despite the questions onpolymorphism and heaps and virtual machines, the question interviewers really want an answer to is : Would I have a beer with this guy?"... So - smile! Be honest! Be yourself! * "your future teammates (most probably, your interviewer is one of them) want to be sure that they can rely on you. That you can work yourself" - another quote from the same book. So - prove them that you can work yourself! * don't answer immediately, think a little before. But think aloud! Be sure that your interviewer knows that you're thinking and not answering ;) * if you find a mistake in your answer (even in question that you answered 10 minutes ago) - don't be afraid to fix it * if you have ANY question - ask it! It could change your answer really a lot.. (one guy answered to 10 my specifying questions - "I don't know".. And it was actually right answers ;) but usually you will receive a lot of information) * yeah, I messed all the time. I did errros. I did one HUGE error, most stupid error in my last few years. But - I talked out loud! I talked all the time, I talked about what I think about it etc. So, again - talk out loud! This is your mantra for interview * if you see how you can optimize your solution - optimize it! Optimize it all the time. And talk out loud why you think it's better! Don't be afraid to change you code. But be sure that you will finish your task in time! * stand out from the "crowd". Be different. Of course, probably you should not paint you hair in blue color ;) but be sure that you are not like "everyone". You should be "a little different". They should remember you * ask about requirements for code. They could be different - maybe, much more loose than you think (e.g., when I said that my solution will be non-optimal, one guy said that he need ..A.. solution. My solution was horrible, but I "delivered" it. Just in last seconds of our interview. He looked very happy...) AFTER INTERVIEW Have a beer! You deserve it.

I applied at a job fair. I was contacted within a week for the position of Software Development Engineer at Amazon Vancouver. There were no recruiter screening interviews. The recruiter got in touch with me over email and scheduled a phone interview. I had to reschedule the interview because I wasn't well the day before the interview. There was no problem with that. They did send a pdf file containing information on what to expect in the interview. Essentially, the document said you should be prepared to answer programming problems, algorithms, data structures, distributed systems, databases, networks and operating systems. The recruiter was nice and prompt in responding to emails and inquiries. However, the phone interview itself was a very unpleasant experience. I don't know what kind of phones were used but I had difficulty in hearing the interviewer and he seemed to get annoyed by it. He ruined my overall experience.

The questions in the first round were fairly straightforward if you use data structures like trees and linked lists for your work regularly. If you're working in areas where you don't use those data structures regularly, you may find the problems challenging. The question I was asked was "Given a sorted linked list, create a binary tree with the array with minimum height." Note that the question specified only binary tree and not binary search tree.   1 Answer

One interview by phone. I thought I've answered all of the questions correctly but did not pass to next phase. Asked about matrix, memory optimization, complexity... He asked a lot of questions and in the end, I had to write an algorithm. He hanged up the call and gave me 10 minutes to solve the problem. I could do it in less time and he called me and asked to explain my algorithm. Since it was an international call, I was not listening the interviewer very well too, but he was incredibly calm and repeated everything patiently.

He asked the best way to store boolean values on memory. I said an array but he wanted more, so in the end I said BinaryVector class. He asked why a binary vector is a better option but I couldn't answer that. I told him that I don't know the internal implementation.   2 Answers

Applied online via third party site, received an email later that day to setup a phone interview. The first attempt at an interview (Saturday) didn't happen because my interviewer had to leave early. One thing to note was that, I asked the HR person who was going to interview me and it changed on the day, so don't be surprised if that happens. I was able to reschedule the week after. My interviewer was again with a different person then I expected and we had trouble with the phone lines so we couldn't hear each other that well. Because of that he skimmed past questions about my experience and went straight to coding. I understand given the circumstances it was probably the best option but because of that I wasn't able to build a rapport with my interviewer and that put me off my game a little. I am however not making excuses, you've got to work with what you've got. I was asked 2 tech questions, not particularly difficult but also not particularly obvious, well for me that is. I believe after a bit of figuring out and some help from him I was just about to finish the first question but the Collabeit site kept erroring so we had to stop the interview. Having not completed either question, he then throw me a bone and said, email the answers within 2 hours. I was able to answer #1 but #2 had me stumped, the actually question he asked was relatively simple, the parameters in which I could answer it however, was not in a way I was accustomed to. Needless to say I couldn't answer the second question and didn't have enough time to document my thought process in my different attempts to find solution. I pretty much knew I wasn't going to be considered for a face to face interview, so after a week went by with no communications I emailed the HR lady asking if I was still in consideration, which I knew i wasn't, she told me that were still reviewing my interview feedback. The day after I was officially declined.

I applied to this position a while before I got contacted to set up a phone interview. Even though I had already gotten and started a job by that time, I was excited to interview with Amazon, a great company. The first round phone interview went very smoothly. The interviewer was very friendly. The question fair to easy for a first round. I guess I did well on the first round since I got to the second one. We set up a time for a second phone interview, however confirming receipt of the email slipped my mind (never let this kind of stuff happen). I only realized that an hour before the interview time. I quickly sent the interview coordinator an email. When she didn't reply within few minutes I gave her a call to try to save the situation. She said she will ping the interviewer and send me an email. After not receiving any sign for a while, I sent her a second email. Very disappointingly, I didn't hear from her until six days later (very disrespectful), when I received an email saying that they have decided to proceed with other condidates. And apparently that decision was made based on the results of the first interview, a statement that contradicts the company's invitation for a second round interview. All this to say that I had a very bad experience overall, which seriously degraded the image I had of Amazon. The actions of the interview coordinator unfortunately ruined an otherwise very enjoyable experience. I feel that my case was handled in a very unprofessional and disrespectful way.

I interviewed with Amazon over the phone for the SDE position. I had dropped of my resume with one of their representatives at a career fair at my school in January 2012, and received an email in September asking to schedule an interview. My first interview over the phone did not go very well, as it was my first interview for a software company--over the phone, no less--and was rather nervous. The second interview went much better as I was more prepared and a lot more confident. Both interviews started off with a brief introduction where I was asked to tell the interviewer about who I was and some of the projects that I had worked on in the past. We then moved on to the technical questions; some of the questions asked were: what is the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree, how do you detect a cycle in a singly-linked list, and a more complicated programming question. I received an email the week after my second interview saying that I would not be advancing further in the interview process.

Given a set of number ranges, i.e. [1,5], [3,6], [7,9], write a program to merge overlapping number ranges. In the above example, the result should be [1,6], [7,9].   2 Answers

A recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn and informed me about a recruiting event for Amazon's eCommerce Platforms Division taking place in my area in a month. I was surprised that Amazon would fly interviewing teams to different cities for recruitment (the usual process is for them to invite candidates to Seatlle). I expressed interest and the recruiter asked me to go through a phone screen as early as possible because the interview slots were filling up. The interview team was going to be in my city only for two days. I setup the phone interview for the same day. The phone screen as quick and the interviewer asked me a somewhat difficult question that I did not expect interviewers to ask during a phone interview. He indicated that I need not code and that he wanted to just hear how I would solve the problem. Fortunately for me, the insight on how to solve came pretty quickly and the interviewer seemed happy. After three days, I contacted the interviewer about my phone interview and he gave the good news that I had cleared it and that I would take part in the recruiting event in my city. He said he would contact me about exact date and time in the next few days which he did. The interview took place in a building in a famous area that Amazon must have leased for the event. My interview loop consisted of a 15 minute intro by the recruiter (different from the one who contacted me through LinkedIn) followed by three 45 minute technical interview and one 45 minute hiring manager interview. I thought I screwed up the first one and did well on the other two technical interviews. The last one was not a technical, the questions were more about how I would handle stress, what to expect at Amazon etc., The recruiter said that Amazon typically moves very quickly if they like a candidate and asked me to expect an email the same day (Friday) or by Sunday latest. The email finally arrived on Sunday with good news after an agonizing wait.

I am not going to reveal the questions here. I had heard about the question that the first interviewer asked. It is an open-ended question. The interviewer qucikly became frustrated with the direction I was going and had to rein me in a little bit. I was frustrated about why then he asked such an open ended question. Anyway, his intentions were clear when he asked the follow-up which I found to be an interesting one. But unfortunately time was running out at that point and I quickly suggested some ways I would solve the problem. In hindsight, I realized this was an important question because Amazon had designed a product around it and uses it very heavily internally. The second interview was about the application of efficient data structures to solve a problem. I quickly arrived at the solution and coded it. There was more time left in the interview and we talked about problems arising in a distributed architecture setup. The third interviewer was nice and asked if I needed a restroom break. I gladly took his offer. This interview was also about the application of an efficient data structure. I initially proposed a multi-threaded solution to his problem. He asked a few follow-ups which I was able to answer. But he eventually asked me to give a single-threaded solution which required the realization of a need for an efficient data structure. I quickly realized that I needed a data structure to solve a problem, but he had to give me some hints to arrive at the right one which ironically was what I had proposed for the question asked by the second interviewer. The last interview was not very technical. The interviewer asked about what I did my current role, how I would handle stress, what to expect at Amazon etc., After the interview was over, he walked me out of the building and wished me good luck.   Answer Question

Going through my university's career services, Amazon got in touch with me for an interview early in the year. After a 90-minute interview in two 45-minute sessions, the process was over. I heard back from them about a month and a half later, with an internship offer for the summer. I had about 10 days to accept and they covered my relocation and travel.

Difficult: Finding a particular combination of numbers from an array with particular properties, without a floor or ceiling on how many different numbers could be involved.   Answer Question

Aug 11, 2012
---------------
I began with a phone screen, then received an invitation for an on-site interview. There were - technically - 6 interviews; one with HR, 4 technical, and one with the manager I would be working for over lunch. The process took about 4 hours in total (45 minutes per interview, with HR being short). The phone screen was fairly simple and short (about half an hour), and the on-site had much more interesting questions; only one was what I would consider a 'staple' coding question that it would be likely to have come across in another interview (I actually had used it a couple times when I was interviewing others in the past). The emphasis in the interviews seemed primarily about optimization and refinement - while the questions were not (for the most part) that difficult, the interviewers strongly pushed at improving solutions, catching edge cases, and fixing bugs, rather than implementing difficult or esoteric algorithms.

One of the interviewers (not the 'bar-raiser') asked a very open ended question about how to design a specific system in a way that could effectively and efficiently scale to meet Amazon's needs.   Answer Question

first round was a written test which had 3 question completely based on Algorithms and Data Structures which lasted for 2 hrs. In second round first i was asked about my projects and then he gave me one question to code and ten a series of question and asked me to tell the solution orally, all of them were on algos Third round i was asked abt project first and then a question to code on algos fourth round was same as third round but he was very particular abt questions on my project and the question i was asked to code was difficult than the previous ones

most difficult question was on infinite array. They keep changing some information given in the beginning and ask us how would that change our solution.they keep asking u did u complete many times which means they expect u to code fast   Answer Question

It was in-campus recruitment. Initially there was an online round consisting of 20 multiple choice questions and 2 programming questions. The MCQs were mix of aptitude and technical. 17 students were shortlisted, out of which top 5 scorers advanced to interview round. The others had further technical round and one of the questions was on doubly linked list. It was an elimination round and those who passed, joined the top 5 for interview. The interview was mostly technical (no HR interview) and there was one interviewer in each interview round. Questions were asked related to project work we have done in the past(as mentioned in resume). Besides, we had to write code (on A4 sheets) regarding trees and lots of question on time-complexity. No. of interviews varied from student to student. I had two.

The recruiter discussed with me the position in the Toronto office on the phone to asses my suitability. Afterwards I was invited for an in-person technical interview for the following week. The interview included four 1-on-1 sessions. Three of which were technical, one of which was more traditional HR (with the group's hiring manager). The first technical interview was the standard stuff about binary search trees and hashing. The second one (bar raiser) had a question about path finding in a grid-maze with obstacles. Third interview had some questions regarding string manipulation in C and finding pairs that sum to k in an unsorted integer array.

Recruiter reached me with a schedule in a weekend for f2f interview. I think around 20 candidates were there. Had 4 rounds of technical discussions in a day. Each took 45minutes to 1hour. Mostly targeted with 2 major questions per round. If you totally mess up in one round, don't worry you might get another round as a chance. Think in broad way. Avoid brute-force approach and give the best solution u think in the beginning itself. If you think about multiple efficient solutions explain all of them briefly. And explain the complexities (time/space). Practice writing code in a paper. Interviewers will need it for reference and they'll take notes during your interview (they might be typing while you explain). You can ask them to stop it if it disturbs you. Its easy if you practice data structures and algorithms.

It consisted of 2 phone interviews each lasted about 45mins. The questions I could remember are: Assume you have an array A of n numbers (non-zero real numbers, not sorted), you need to create an array B, where the ith element of B equals the product of all elements in A except A[i]. In other words: B[i] = A[0]*A[1]*....A[i-1]*A[i+1]*....A[n-1] Do not use divisions. Only use addition and multiplications. Minimize the time complexity(use as few as multiplications as possible). The solution is easy: use helper array A1, A2: A1[i] is product of A[0] to A[i-1], use dynamic programming to calculate gradually and save multiplications A2[i] is product of A[n-1] to A[i+1], use same technique as above only in another direction. B[i]=A1[i]*A2[i] The third interview is from a SDET team asking me if I'm interested in testing and some testing questions. I feel that I went on well. However I got declined a week after. Probably they have people interviewed before me fill in the position.

given non-zero number array A, create array B where B[i] = product of all elements in A except A[i].   5 Answers

Amazon HR contacted me and scheduled a phone interview. One of the development manager interviewed me, he gave very detailed explanation about the division and then asked some questions. He was polite.

At least one question involving a hash table. Amazon is famous for asking questions about hash tables. Either they ask about the hash table constructs in various programming languages (like Java and Perl, hash vs. map, etc..), or a coding problem where the hash table affords an O(N) or O(1) solution.   Answer Question

I was contacted by a recruiter for a position that I applied online. She setup an interview one of the team members from Kindle organisation. He called me at the exact time and asked few question from the resume. With in couple of minute he jumped into technical questions. He asked a question and we need to tell him our initial thoughts about the problem. He ask us to improve the algorithm in terms of time complexity. The discussion goes on inorder to improve the efficiency of algorithm. Then he stops us at a point and asks us to write code in callaboration tool. he will looking at the code we are writing. They dont care about small syntax errors. After couple of days I contacted the recruiter and she said that I was not picked up for an interview. I can understand the reason, I am not that good at algorithms and data structures. So my advice would be going through all the algorithms and datastructures before you apply online. Also I would suggest to work on as many problems as yo u can, so that you can get know multiple ways of solving a problem.

Called at the exact minute and immediately started technical questions. Interviewer was asking for the basic layout plan of the program. I didn't have to read any specific lines of code. You can ask questions at the end. Articulating your thoughts are most important here. You can have a few minutes to think about the layout. So I would recommend having a sheet of paper in front of you, draw out what you need and spend the rest of your time thinking about how to translate that picture through the phone.

I first applied to their career website. Then, 3 phone interviews followed. Each was about one hour long and one month apart. The interviewer would state an algorithm problem and all the questions would be based on this problem. It was possible to solve the problems with many approaches, but only the most optimized one will be accepted by the interviewer. I know nothing about finding talented people, so maybe this is a good way. But, I still felt it's a bit unfair that you are given less than 10 minutes to give the most optimal answer. The interviews themselves were alright, but the process was not pleasant. After the initial inquiry, HR sent me an email to request for the first interview. I replied and waited 2 weeks for the HR to schedule me the interview time. I did fine in the first interview. After another week, HR sent me a request for the second interview and it took another week for her to schedule it. So 1.5 months already passed since I applied. I did alright in the second interview. And the same process for the HR, waited 2 weeks for her to schedule me the 3rd interview, which she scheduled on Black Friday. I sent her an email to confirm the unusual time, but she did not reply. As expected, the interviewer was a no call. A few days later, HR apologized saying the interviewer had an emergency. Anyways, 3rd interview was rescheduled, but I did not do well. By the time I got the rejection email from them, 3 months had passed since I entered my application. One of the interviewer was proud of his profitable company. He said the engineers in Amazon are solving real world problems, implying the rest of us are not?

We had to write code. Then they called me to their office for interviews. There were 2 rounds of interviews (lots of waiting, took almost 12 hours to get done) with a panel of 2 members each. Then, there was a phone interview with the hiring manager, and then one more interview at their office. One good thing about the interview process was that the HRs conveyed the feedback from the previous interview immediately and kept me posted on how many interviews remained.

I submitted my resume to an Amazon recruiter during a career fair and I was contacted for an interview a couple days later. The HR person who's in touch with me always takes about a week or two before responding to any of my emails, so scheduling the interview itself was a pain. She asked me when I'd be available for the next 2 weeks, I reply right away, she replied two weeks later apologizing for missing my time and ask me for the next 2 weeks I'm available. This went on for about a month. Finally I was passed to another recruiter, who responded a lot faster and scheduled my interview within a week. The interview itself was technical, a couple programming problems and some OOP design concepts. I was asked to code on paper while explaining my thought process on the phone, which I always find hard to do, but I thought I did okay. I didn't have any problems with the coding itself. I was contacted for a second round of interview a week later, and scheduled the interview 2 weeks after the call. It was another technical phone interview with Java concepts and programming problems. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a thick accent and the phone connection wasn't very clear (I heard a lot of background noises from his end) so I found it hard to understand him. He asked me about how to design the system at Amazon for displaying the availability of an item; this one I couldn't answer (more detail about the question below). I was also asked if I knew scripting languages/PERL. I was asked a little bit about my school projects, if there are any challenges that I faced, and asked about what I think is the hardest course.

She was very calm and cool. Asked me about my favorite subject. Any project i did on that. A brief intro reqd on that. Then she went to technical part. Asked about Hashtable. Asked to explain how would you implement one. Data structure and how and what hash function will do. Cross questioned a lot with logic proposed. Gave clues where implementation or way i think is wrong, gave a chance to re-think and correct myself (many times during whole interview on different questions). Problems with hashtables, how would i solve such a problem (gave me an example scenario,collision). Asked me to design and code an algorithm (actual code NOT pseudo code). Asked to optimize, calculate Big O and how and what each steps takes (again gave a clue when she thought i was wrong, in optimization. i corrected it quickly). Asked about some design patterns and in the end gave me a chance to ask some questions i had. She was very calm and very supportive and gave me clues where-ever my approach or code was wrong/or could be better, was patient enough to give me time to identify my mistake myself and correct it. Overall a fantastic person with a lot of stress on fundamentals, nothing too hi fi and would still test your skills of problem solving and depth of fundamentals. I'm still waiting for my result but i'm 50/50 on my selection, as i did solved all the questions she asked and to some extent efficiently, but i did stumbled on leaving out edge cases(big mistake) and could have focused myself on efficiency of solution i proposed until she made me think of better solution(which i did in the end and she seemed ok with answers, but little practice of considering edge cases and habit of double checking code for optimization would have done more good for my chances). Keeping my fingers crossed and rate the interviewer 10/10 and way she took interview was pleasing as much as it was a great learning experience on what to take care of when interviewer asks a question.

Recently went through a really long interview process with Amazon which ended in no offer. The process included 3 phone interviews and as per me, I did well in them. I may have taken a little long on some common (still tricky questions) as I haven't looked at them before but in the end I did manage to come up with a solution on my own with some hints from the interviewer. Apart from this, I really can't see any other issue as most other questions I already knew solutions for. I was really hoping for an onsite interview opportunity but instead got a reject. I know amazon have some high bars for their positions but from this process, I really can't make out where I fell short. Anyway will try again in future.

I interviewed with Amazon at campus. I went through a written test which consisted of multiple choice questions - mostly around data structures, networking, SQL and aptitude, and two coding questions. I don't really remember signing any NDA and since the interview was more than four years ago, I'll spill the beans. Overall, the interview process went really smooth. Amazon arrived at campus at 6 AM, went through their sales pitch using a PPT presentation. They gave away iPods (yes, iPods were novelty in those days) via lucky draws. They then conducted the test whose results were out before noon. My first interview was at 1 PM and the last was at 4 PM. I got confirmation at midnight. The process was really smooth, no hassles or hidden components in the compensation offered.

They also presented me what they were working on (the web services behind amazon.com).

The first round was a written technical and intelligence test. Second round was a coding round where two questions were related to BST and one related to Strings. The interview were held on next day for the 30 shortlisted candidates out of 300 odd who attended the initial rounds. The first interview began with questions from the code I had written in the second round. Was asked to optimize it, and explain the code (draw recursion stacks and explain how hashset works were auxillary questions asked as I was explaining my code). If you get stuck, they do give you a hint. But one hint per interview is the max you can expect. Duration: 45mins. Second interview was held 3 hours after the first one. And this one was with a Development Lead. I guess this was a bar raiser for me, a concept unique to Amazon. This interview can be difficult or easy depending on what kind of projects you've done, what kind of activities you engage in. Typically, this round assesses your overall qualities, and assesses if you're fit to work for Amazon.com. Was a really long interview, about 2 and half hours. Third interview was again on algorithms and data structures. I was asked an odd question regarding race condition, and synchronized blocks in java. I was given no hints in this round, although I eventually managed to answer all the questions he asked. Duration: 1hour 15mins. Foruth interview was with a senior developer at Amazon.com. He asked four questions, and told me to write my best code for each, with utmost optimization. He told me I can take all the time in the world to solve the problems. Each one was algorithm based. After I had answered all the four, I walked him through all the test cases. Later he asked a question from Probablity, which I struggled to answer, but I guess it didn't matter as my performances in the previous rounds were excellent.

All rounds focused on skills like Problem Solving, Coding, Data Structures and Algorithms. There were some puzzles in one of the rounds. One thing i want to highlight about coding is they take it seriously. You need to avoid any logical error with even the minutest of edge case and the code needs to be what they call "production ready". The questions were pretty standard and a quick google search would tell you most of them.

Everybody seemed to know their stuff and were fairly nice. Both phone screens were similar in that they asked general questions about my experience based on my resume and then dived into OOP design questions and one or two algorithm questions. I was asked this question in the first interview: Given an immutable singly linked list of some object with pointer to next element, find the nth element from the end of the linked list.

About 40~45 minutes phone interview. Very nice interviewer and didn't make me nervous at all. The interview started with some questions related to my experience like what kind of project I did and what's my duty and position in my current job. What's the most difficult things I've experienced and how did I solved it. After 10 minutes self intro, the interviews told me he wants to ask some technical questions. First he asked an SQL question. He gave me two tables(for ex, supermarket and items) and two columns in each table and asked me to read the query that calculates the prices of certain item. Second question is XML question. He gave me a simple xml file and asked me what's the most efficient way to get some data set. And then asked me if I can read a linux command for this.( My answer is to use xQuery 'cause I think this might be related to the previous question but he told me he's just asking me thought. So I'm not sure is it an algorithm question) Then he asked me to write a java program to print power set without using the ready-to-use power set class if there is. After that, he asked me to give a word to describe a good software and a word to describe good supervisor. (This might be my worst part.) He asked me to send my program back asap. I'm waiting for the second one on next week.

Was scheduled for a phone interview round last week , a week after I applied. The interview started with resume scanning and the interviewer asked questions on my projects, which I answered confidently. Later, I was asked about Linked List, Binary trees. He asked me what big oh notation meant, and the time complexities of linked list and binary trees. I was asked what was the worst case scenario of a Binary Search tree. He then asked me what balanced and unbalanced binary trees were, and asked me to write a code on self balancing binary trees. I have not received a reply about the outcome for the phone interview since last week My perception is that the company looks for applicants who demonstrate a 'can do it attitude' when given a tough problem.

Other than that, all coding questions! Depending on your coding speed, he/she will ask you about 2-3 questions. he/she usually starts by asking you to write an algorithm and then asks for runtime/space complexity, then asks if you can do better. You might expect to read all your code to the interviewer, or he/she might send you a link to online notepad so that he/she can see you typing. Overall the experience is pretty good.

I found the skills questions to be vague, and the more you tried to formulate an answer the more requirements they would place in your way. I found it to be a great exercise and was happy for the experience. Not only did it shine a spotlight on my inability to think in code on paper, but I also learned some things too. The interviewers were extremely polite and understanding if I was not familiar with a concept, they would attempt to educate you so that you can still formulate and answer to their question and/or problem.

I had to write code in all of the interviews. So, brush your code up before you appear. Take initiative and ask them questions. And try to understand the problem well.

I was interviewed by one of the tech leads and initially I was asked questions about projects on my resume. Following that the person asked various questions about the details of Java, such as "how is the Java garbage collection implemented?" Since I was not familiar with the implementation details of the garbage collector and only knew about the general working of it, I really couldn't answer that. Also, I was asked questions about data structures, which if you hadn't seen before, you wouldn't be able to piece together the answer anyway.

Some time back, I appeared in an interview with Amazon and had a really good experience. Though, I couldn't make it, it was the best interview experience I have ever had. My interview consisted of 7 rounds, 2 telephonic and 5 on-site interview @ HYD. Here are questions from my interviews. I am not able to recall some more questions but that were not hard to crack else I must be able to recall those :) Suggestions:They asked a number of question regarding any data structure you use. Like Hash tables, heaps, arrays etc. And also asked comparison between them. So whatever data structures you are using you must be having a sound knowledge of that. Also gather knowledge about sorting and other things. Another input is that Amazon guys don't like to give hints. Though they give hints if you are stuck, but don't count that as good. PS: This was all what was asked from me in Amazon Interview. Except one question about Fibonacci's, I have done well but unfortunately I couldn't make it. I am thinking of discussing some of these questions in upcoming posts. I have already discussed about 'virtual destructors' here.
